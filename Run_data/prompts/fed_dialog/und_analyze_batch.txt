You will be given a batch of {{number}} samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.

Your task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.

You should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Understanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?
- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.
- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.
- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.
