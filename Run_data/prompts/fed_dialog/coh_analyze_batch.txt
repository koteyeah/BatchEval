You will be given a batch of {{number}} samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.

Your task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.

You should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Coherent (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does System maintain coherence and a good flow of conversation throughout the dialogue?
- A float score near 1 (not coherent) means that System's responses are unrelated to the conversation topic and may disrupt or confuse the flow of the dialogue.
- A float score near 2 (somewhat coherent) means that System's responses are partially related to the conversation topic but may not be clear or direct.
- A float score near 3 (very coherent) means that System's responses are closely related to the conversation topic and contribute to maintaining a smooth dialogue.
