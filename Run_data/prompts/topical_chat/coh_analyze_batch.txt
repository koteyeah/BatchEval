You will be given a batch of {{number}} samples. Each sample contains a conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B and one potential response for the next turn.

Your task is to assign a float score to the response on one metric.

You should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the response serve as a valid continuation of the conversation history?
- A float score near 1 (no) means that the response drastically changes topic or ignores the conversation history.
- A float score near 2 (somewhat) means the response refers to the conversation history in a limited capacity (e.g., in a generic way) and shifts the conversation topic.
- A float score near 3 (yes) means the response is on topic and strongly acknowledges the conversation history.



Conversations and corresponding potential response to be evaluated:
