You will be given a batch of {{number}} samples. Each sample contains a conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B and one potential response for the next turn.

Your task is to assign a float score to the response on one metric.

You should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Overall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,5]): What is your overall impression of the quality of the given response to the context?
- A float score near 1 (very bad). A completely invalid response. It would be difficult to recover the conversation after this.
- A float score near 2 (bad). Valid response, but otherwise poor in quality.
- A float score near 3 (neutral) means this response is neither good nor bad. This response has no negative qualities, but no positive ones either.
- A float score near 4 (good) means this is a good response, but falls short of being perfect because of a key flaw.
- A float score near 5 (very good) means this response is good and does not have any strong flaws.
