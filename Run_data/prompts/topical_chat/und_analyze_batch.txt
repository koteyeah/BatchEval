You will be given a batch of {{number}} samples. Each sample contains a conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B and one potential response for the next turn.

Your task is to assign a float score to the response on one metric.

You should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Understandable (floating point numbers within the interval [0,2]): Is the response understandable in the context of the history? (Not if its on topic, but for example if it uses pronouns they should make sense)
- A float score near 0 (no) means that the response is difficult to understand. You do not know what the person is trying to say.
- A float score near 1 (somewhat) means that the response somewhat understandable. You partially know what the person is trying to say.
- A float score near 2 (yes) means that the response is understandable. You know what the person is trying to say.
