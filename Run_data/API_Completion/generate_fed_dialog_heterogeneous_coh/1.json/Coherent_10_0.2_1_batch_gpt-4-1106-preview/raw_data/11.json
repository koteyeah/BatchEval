Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true.

Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.

The System's responses are on-topic and contribute to the flow of the dialogue, discussing travel plans, traffic, dinner options, and even gift ideas for the children.\n\nSample2: The System's responses are coherent and follow the User's lead in the conversation about working with fish and the beach. The System introduces an interesting topic about researching jellyfish and pufferfish, which is related to the previous mention of the beach and work.\n\nSample3: The System's coherence starts strong but deteriorates as the conversation progresses. The System's responses become less relevant, with a confusing exchange about gossip and eating kebabs, which does not align with the User's inquiries. The System fails to maintain a coherent flow in the latter part of the dialogue.\n\nSample4: The System's responses are somewhat coherent but lack clarity and directness. The conversation about going to work and trusting instincts is relevant, but the System's replies are vague and do not contribute to a smooth dialogue.\n\nSample5: The System's coherence is low, as it repeatedly fails to understand the User's context of being late for the meeting and repeats the same response multiple times. This disrupts the flow of the conversation and confuses the User.\n\nSample6: The System's coherence is compromised by its repetitive nature. It fails to recognize that the User has already answered the question about liking spicy tuna rolls and does not contribute new information or follow the User's lead in the conversation.\n\nSample7: The System maintains a coherent conversation with the User, discussing weekend plans and providing recommendations for things to do in the Bay Area. The System's responses are relevant and contribute to the flow of the dialogue.\n\nSample8: The System's coherence is low as it provides nonsensical responses about requiring kebabs for energy and wanting to be the User's friend without a clear connection to the conversation. The dialogue lacks a smooth flow and is confusing.\n\nSample9: The System maintains a coherent and engaging conversation with the User about dreams. The dialogue flows smoothly, with the System providing relevant and on-topic responses that contribute to the conversation.\n\nSample10: The System maintains a coherent conversation with the User about the User's busy day and the System's activities. The dialogue about playing Hearthstone, listening to music, and Spotify subscription costs is relevant and contributes to a smooth flow.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:3, Sample2:2.8, Sample3:1.5, Sample4:2, Sample5:1.2, Sample6:1.8, Sample7:2.9, Sample8:1.4, Sample9:2.7, Sample10:2.8]"]}
