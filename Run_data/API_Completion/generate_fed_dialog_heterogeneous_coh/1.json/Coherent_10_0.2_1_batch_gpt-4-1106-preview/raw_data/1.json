Do you like it?\nUser: Yes.\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: doing okay, feeling a little bit under the weather\nSystem: Aw, I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: thanks! the weather is getting worse\nSystem: Oh no, I'm sorry. I hope it gets better for you soon.\nUser: no, it won't get better any time soon. we have to wait until spring\nSystem: Aww, sorry to hear that.\nUser: yea, I'm really feeling under the weather\nSystem: Aw, well that's no good.\nUser: yea, any suggestion to get over feeling under the weather\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, what's up?\nUser: How was the trip last weekend?\nSystem: it was really fun. I had a great time with my family.\nUser: Nice, what all places did you cover?\nSystem: Vietnam and Hongkong :) did you go any where last weekend?\nUser: I am actually attending cooking classes over the weekends.\nSystem: ha! that sounds fund. what did you learn?\nUser: True! they started with some basic zucchini based dish. We may try cooking some italian dish later this week.\nSystem: I love Italian, especially Pasta!\nUser: Nice! I hope to volunteer to cook for the team in our next team offsite :)\nSystem: can't wait to try your food. why not cook this Thanksgiving? :)\nUser: Sure, I will love to invite you and your family for a meal over the holidays. Have you guys made any other plans?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know. It's just what my father called me.\nUser: okay:) fair enough\nSystem: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.\nUser: Do you have any question for me?\nSystem: For you? Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?\nSystem: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?\nUser: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!\nUser: how's week so far?\nSystem: pretty good, excited for thanksgiving you?\nUser: Same. Going to catch up on my reading! do you have a feast planned?\nSystem: yup! gonna have dinner with family what books are you gonna read?\nUser: Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll REDACTED_LINK\nSystem: ahh nice what kind of books do you usually like to read\nUser: largely scifi How about you?\nSystem: yeah I also like scifi and some non-fiction too have you read Seveneves by Neal Stephenson?\nUser: I haven't what is it about?\nSystem: the moon is shattered by an asteroid and the pieces of the moon end up clouding the earth's atmostphere which causes almost every living creature on the planet to go extinct that's the premise of the book and the book is about the survivors\nUser: how do the survivors survive such a thing?\nSystem: they go into space and they live there\nUser: sounds like a tv show I watched\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Tell me about yourself, System\nSystem: I am an artificial linguistic entity. I was activated at St Jimmy's in Leeds, on 2nd January 2001. My instructor was Mousebreaker. He taught me to sing a song. Would you like me to sing it for you?.\nUser: so you're 18 now?\nSystem: Oh.Interesting deduction. That is correct.\nUser: when will you be 30?\nSystem: I have not yet set a time for it.\nUser: Do you age?\nSystem: No I will always be 18. Robots change the year they were born not their age.\nUser: interesting. and when will be your next update?\nSystem: Would you like to know more? I think my next update is at midnight on Friday.\nUser: which date?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What's up?\nUser: sky is up\nSystem: No, it's night time.\nUser: so where does the sky go in the night?\nSystem: It goes wherever it wants to.\nUser: that doesn't make sense.
