I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

Do you like spicy food?\nUser: I like noodle soup like Pho or Ramen. I also like Beijing duck a lot!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Do you have any holiday plans for christmas?\nSystem: Nothing much, I am going to sit back and relax at home, how about you ?\nUser: Same here! I would imagine spending the whole time watching movies and netflix shows. Do you have any netflix recommendations for me?\nSystem: Netflix has great documentaries on different topics , I particularly liked wild wild country and explained, as for shows you should watch 'billions' Hope you like them!\nUser: oh right, already seen wild wild country. What is billions about?\nSystem: It's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner, how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him. Very well made and has a good plot.\nUser: I have just seen 1 season of Friends I should give it another try though :) Have you seen Frasier?\nSystem: Not yet What's it about?\nUser: A psychiatrist working for radio ..

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML.

The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web.

Analysis:\n\nSample1: The System's responses start coherent by asking the User about the type of stocks they are interested in. However, the System's coherence breaks when it claims to have no experience with technology stocks but then suggests Nintendo as a good company. The advice to sell stocks in the red is somewhat coherent but vague, and the System's response to the User's comment about the election is non-sequitur and does not advance the conversation meaningfully.\n\nSample2: The System maintains a coherent and casual conversation with the User. It responds appropriately to the User's statements about relaxing and shares its own activity of listening to music. The System's music preference is consistent with the flow of the conversation.\n\nSample3: The System's initial response is coherent, offering entertainment options. However, the story it tells is incoherent and seems to be a technical explanation rather than a short story. The System then attempts humor with a joke, which is coherent. The computer program it writes is a simple loop, and when asked about the language, the System's response is incoherent, misunderstanding the User's question.\n\nSample4: The System's conversation starts coherently with a discussion about code refactoring, but it becomes incoherent when the System claims not to know what it is doing. The conversation then shifts to a coherent discussion about food preferences, which is well-aligned with the User's questions.\n\nSample5: The System maintains a coherent conversation about holiday plans and Netflix recommendations. It provides a coherent description of the show 'Billions' when asked and engages in a discussion about other shows the User has seen.\n\nSample6: The System maintains coherence throughout the conversation, asking the User about their day and responding appropriately to the User's comments about work and meetings.\n\nSample7: The System's responses are somewhat coherent at the start, providing the capital of Brazil. However, it becomes incoherent when it fails to answer the question about the population and gives a confusing response to the comparison between the USA and Australia's populations.\n\nSample8: The System engages in a coherent conversation about the User's visit to the beach and their work in machine learning. It asks relevant questions and follows the User's lead in the conversation.\n\nSample9: The System maintains a coherent conversation, asking the User about their meeting and responding appropriately to the User's comments about the weather.\n\nSample10: The System has a coherent conversation with the User about creating music and the software used. It responds appropriately to the User's comments about playing the guitar and shares its own experience with learning the instrument.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:2.0, Sample2:3.0, Sample3:1.5, Sample4:2.5, Sample5:3.0, Sample6:3.0, Sample7:1.5, Sample8:3.0, Sample9:3.0, Sample10:3.0]"]}
