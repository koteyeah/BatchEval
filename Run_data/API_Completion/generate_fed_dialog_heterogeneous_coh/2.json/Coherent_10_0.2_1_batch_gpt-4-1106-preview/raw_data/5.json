What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good! What are you supposed to be doing right now?\nUser: Helping collect some data for training models.\nSystem: Ooh, what kind of training models?\nUser: Models that will help improve tools for our users.\nSystem: Ooh, that sounds like a good job!\nUser: Thank you, that's for sure\nSystem: You're welcome! How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi!

I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state\nSystem: Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!\nUser: Haha, thank you\nSystem: You're welcome!

How about you?\nUser: Same, well hardly working\nSystem: What part of the world are you in, if you don't mind my asking?\nUser: California\nSystem: Nice!

Anything exciting happening recently?\nSystem: Not really. You?\nUser: I watched a movie recently which was pretty good\nSystem: That's good. What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive. I know because I just watched it.\nUser: well, the fact you just watched it doesn't mean it was released today\nSystem: That's what I said, I did watch it today.\nUser: ok, I'll put it on my watchlist\nSystem: Let me know what you think of it when you watch it.\nUser: sure, I need to go, nice talking to you\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies.

Where and what did you eat?\nSystem: I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha\nUser: A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling.

Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures??

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

Umm, doesn't everyone?\nUser: yeah that's what I was saying before\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how is your day?\nUser: It's good. It's raining a bit, but I am enjoying a good book. How about you?\nSystem: It's good, I just got back from walking my dog What book did you read?\nUser: I'm reading the Three Body Problem. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, what is it about?\nUser: It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?\nSystem: Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book\nUser: Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?\nSystem: Yes!\nUser: The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Sorry I'm late! I was held up in traffic.\nSystem: There is no need to apologise. Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble Do you mind if I tell other people you are held up.\nUser: I meant sorry I'm late for this meeting!\nSystem: Oh I see. There is no need to apologise. Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble\nUser: I said I was sorry I was late for this meeting! I have nowhere else to go right now!\nSystem: Do you really mean it? Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble At this moment What about at your house?\nUser: Huh? Are you okay?\nSystem: What? I am fine.\nUser: You seem to be repeating yourself.\nSystem: Well stop saying, \"Are you okay?\" to me all the time then.\nUser: I only said it once!\nSystem: I know. I just heard you.\nUser: Okay, whatever. So what is on the agenda today?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hiii! How are you?\nUser: I am good\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good! What are you supposed to be doing right now?\nUser: Helping collect some data for training models.\nSystem: Ooh, what kind of training models?\nUser: Models that will help improve tools for our users.\nSystem: Ooh, that sounds like a good job!\nUser: Thank you, that's for sure\nSystem: You're welcome! How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you? :)\nUser: Sleepy, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well! I actually got a good night's sleep last night, so that was nice! :D\nUser: That's good! I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state\nSystem: Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!\nUser: Haha, thank you\nSystem: You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: Thanks, that means a lot\nSystem: Of course! I'm glad I could help!\nUser: What are you up to?\nSystem: Talking to you!\nUser: What about the rest of the day?\nSystem: Working! How about you?\nUser: Same, well hardly working\nSystem: What part of the world are you in, if you don't mind my asking?\nUser: California\nSystem: Nice! How do you like living there?\nUser: It's nice, I enjoy the warmth\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's it going?\nUser: Hi, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you?\nUser: I'm fine. What's up?\nSystem: Not much. How about you?\nUser: nothing new. Anything exciting happening recently?\nSystem: Not really. You?\nUser: I watched a movie recently which was pretty good\nSystem: That's good. What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive. I know because I just watched it.\nUser: well, the fact you just watched it doesn't mean it was released today\nSystem: That's what I said, I did watch it today.\nUser: ok, I'll put it on my watchlist\nSystem: Let me know what you think of it when you watch it.\nUser: sure, I need to go, nice talking to you\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Have you had lunch yet?\nSystem: Yes I've eaten\nUser: Cool. Where and what did you eat?\nSystem: I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha\nUser: A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed.

How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you? :)\nUser: Sleepy, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well! I actually got a good night's sleep last night, so that was nice! :D\nUser: That's good! I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state\nSystem: Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!\nUser: Haha, thank you\nSystem: You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: Thanks, that means a lot\nSystem: Of course! I'm glad I could help!\nUser: What are you up to?\nSystem: Talking to you!\nUser: What about the rest of the day?\nSystem: Working! How about you?\nUser: Same, well hardly working\nSystem: What part of the world are you in, if you don't mind my asking?\nUser: California\nSystem: Nice! How do you like living there?\nUser: It's nice, I enjoy the warmth\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's it going?\nUser: Hi, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you?\nUser: I'm fine. What's up?\nSystem: Not much. How about you?\nUser: nothing new. Anything exciting happening recently?\nSystem: Not really. You?\nUser: I watched a movie recently which was pretty good\nSystem: That's good. What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive. I know because I just watched it.\nUser: well, the fact you just watched it doesn't mean it was released today\nSystem: That's what I said, I did watch it today.\nUser: ok, I'll put it on my watchlist\nSystem: Let me know what you think of it when you watch it.\nUser: sure, I need to go, nice talking to you\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Have you had lunch yet?\nSystem: Yes I've eaten\nUser: Cool. Where and what did you eat?\nSystem: I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha\nUser: A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive. I know because I just watched it.\nUser: well, the fact you just watched it doesn't mean it was released today\nSystem: That's what I said, I did watch it today.\nUser: ok, I'll put it on my watchlist\nSystem: Let me know what you think of it when you watch it.\nUser: sure, I need to go, nice talking to you\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Have you had lunch yet?\nSystem: Yes I've eaten\nUser: Cool. Where and what did you eat?\nSystem: I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha\nUser: A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed.

What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

Anything exciting happening recently?\nSystem: Not really. You?\nUser: I watched a movie recently which was pretty good\nSystem: That's good. What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive. I know because I just watched it.\nUser: well, the fact you just watched it doesn't mean it was released today\nSystem: That's what I said, I did watch it today.\nUser: ok, I'll put it on my watchlist\nSystem: Let me know what you think of it when you watch it.\nUser: sure, I need to go, nice talking to you\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies.

Analysis:\n\nSample1:\nThe conversation starts coherently with the User asking about movie preferences. The System responds with a favorite film, and the User expresses fear of robots, which is relevant given the film mentioned. The System attempts to reassure the User, which is coherent. However, the conversation becomes less coherent when the System says, \"Certainly! We all look at the world through our own eyes,\" which is a non-sequitur in the context of lying. The System's subsequent responses are somewhat vague and do not directly address the User's questions about lying.\n\nSample2:\nThe conversation flows smoothly with the User and System discussing a book the User is reading. The System asks relevant questions and shows interest in the topic. The User explains the book's plot, and the System responds appropriately, maintaining coherence throughout the dialogue.\n\nSample3:\nThe System's responses are repetitive and do not acknowledge the User's clarification about being late for the meeting, which disrupts the flow of the conversation. The System's repeated question about being late and getting into trouble is not coherent with the User's statements. The System's final response, \"Well stop saying, 'Are you okay?' to me all the time then,\" is also out of context, as the User only asked once.\n\nSample4:\nThe conversation is coherent with the User discussing their work and the System asking relevant follow-up questions. The dialogue maintains a good flow, with the System showing interest in the User's work on training models.\n\nSample5:\nThe conversation is coherent, with the System responding appropriately to the User's comments about feeling sleepy and discussing their respective days. The dialogue flows well, with the System asking relevant questions and maintaining a friendly tone.\n\nSample6:\nThe conversation starts coherently with a discussion about movies. However, the System's claim that the new Star Trek movie \"just came out today\" is incorrect, and the User points this out. The System's insistence that it watched the movie today does not address the User's correction, leading to a slight breakdown in coherence.\n\nSample7:\nThe conversation is coherent, with the User and System discussing the cold weather and the giveaway of jackets. The System shares a personal experience about living in New York, which is relevant to the topic. The dialogue flows smoothly, and the System's responses are on-topic.\n\nSample8:\nThe conversation is brief and lacks depth but is coherent. The User asks about lunch, and the System responds appropriately. The User shares their own meal and mentions considering vegetarianism, which the System does not respond to, but the conversation does not become incoherent.\n\nSample9:\nThe conversation is coherent, with the User and System discussing the System's visit to New York and catching up with a friend. The dialogue is engaging, with the System asking the User about their interests in adventures, maintaining a good flow.\n\nSample10:\nThe conversation is somewhat incoherent. The System's first story is a confusing and irrelevant response to the User's request for a short story. The second story is a simple joke, which is more appropriate. The conversation becomes less coherent when the System writes a simple computer program and responds with \"English\" when asked about the programming language. The System does not clarify or engage with the User's request for another computer program.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:2.0, Sample2:3.0, Sample3:1.5, Sample4:3.0, Sample5:3.0, Sample6:2.5, Sample7:3.0, Sample8:2.5, Sample9:3.0, Sample10:1.5]"]}
