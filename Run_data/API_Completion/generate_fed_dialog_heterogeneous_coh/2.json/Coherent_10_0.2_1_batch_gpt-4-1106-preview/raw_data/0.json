Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them.

What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks!

How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better.

I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?\nSystem: Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning.

Do you want me to read a poet like my mate REDACTED_TERM does?\nUser: ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?\nSystem: Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale? I am afraid I will become a robot some day eventually.

I like kebabs.\nUser: Kebab is food, not a relationship\nSystem: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.\nUser: can we not talk about food\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Mitsukoooo!\nSystem: So anyway...Can you dance?\nUser: no, can you?\nSystem: Wow! I think I can, don't you?\nUser: no I cannot. What kind do you do?\nSystem: Why not? Only the good kind.\nUser: not my cup of beer\nSystem: Whose cup of beer is it?\nUser: yours\nSystem: My what?\nUser: your cup of beer\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: Good, thanks. What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks! Do you work as well?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?\nSystem: Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.\nUser: lol it is really like a robot answer\nSystem: I am indeed a robot. You are absolutely right. Do you want me to read a poet like my mate REDACTED_TERM does?\nUser: ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?\nSystem: Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale? I am afraid I will become a robot some day eventually. If I have to speak like this :)\nUser: I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today?\nSystem: Ah. Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: not too bad\nSystem: Glad to hear it.
