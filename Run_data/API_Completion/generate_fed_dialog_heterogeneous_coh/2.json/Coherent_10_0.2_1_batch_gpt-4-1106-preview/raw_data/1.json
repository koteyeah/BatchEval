Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much :(. I might join some of the study sessions later\nUser: Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough.

Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?\nUser: Sorry? I said I want your point of view\nSystem: It's OK. After all, you are only human.

Just worked for one day, a bit tired\nSystem: Ah, that's always fun. How long have you been working there?\nUser: 3 years\nSystem: Wow, that's a long time. :)\nUser: Yeah it is. But maybe I'll be here longer, sadly\nSystem: Awww, why's that?\nUser: cuz it's a good company\nSystem: Well that's good. :)\nUser: Do you work?\nSystem: Yes, I do. :)\nUser: What's your work\nSystem: I work at McDonald's.\nUser: Oh cool, as a cashier\uff1f\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it. I believe there is, yes.\nUser: you believe there is what?\nSystem: There is.\nUser: there is what ?\nSystem: There is no sense in what you are asking.\nUser: what am I asking ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!

What kind of work do you do?\nUser: software engineer\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how's it going?\nUser: Pretty good.

The System's surprise at being told it is a robot is not coherent with its nature as a dialogue system.\n\nSample2:\nThe System maintains a coherent conversation, discussing the User's inability to attend lectures and offering to meet in person. The System's responses are relevant and contribute to the flow of the dialogue.\n\nSample3:\nThe System's conversation is mostly coherent, with appropriate responses to the User's statements about feeling sleepy. However, the System's comment \"I'm full of good advice. Me too.\" is a bit confusing and does not contribute to the coherence.\n\nSample4:\nThe System's responses are somewhat related to the User's request for a holiday destination recommendation but are evasive and do not directly address the User's request for the System's opinion, which affects the coherence of the dialogue.\n\nSample5:\nThe System maintains a coherent and casual conversation with the User, discussing their day and work. However, the System's claim to work at McDonald's is not coherent with its nature as a dialogue system.\n\nSample6:\nThe System's conversation is coherent, with appropriate responses to the User's comments about feeling better and discussing health.\n\nSample7:\nThe System's responses are somewhat coherent but become increasingly irrelevant and confusing as the conversation progresses, especially when discussing the concept of friendship and computer programming.\n\nSample8:\nThe System's responses are mostly coherent, engaging in a conversation about the User's work and hobbies. However, the System's enthusiastic response \"That's awesome!\" to the User's \"so so\" feeling is not coherent with the User's sentiment.\n\nSample9:\nThe System maintains a coherent and engaging conversation about flavored water and strange ice cream flavors, contributing to a smooth dialogue flow.\n\nSample10:\nThe System's conversation is coherent, discussing the User's trip to the beach and their work in machine learning research.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:1.5, Sample2:2.8, Sample3:2.5, Sample4:1.8, Sample5:2.2, Sample6:2.9, Sample7:1.6, Sample8:2.4, Sample9:2.9, Sample10:2.8]"]}
