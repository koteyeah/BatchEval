Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble Do you mind if I tell other people you are held up.\nUser: I meant sorry I'm late for this meeting!\nSystem: Oh I see. There is no need to apologise. Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble\nUser: I said I was sorry I was late for this meeting! I have nowhere else to go right now!\nSystem: Do you really mean it? Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble At this moment What about at your house?\nUser: Huh? Are you okay?\nSystem: What? I am fine.\nUser: You seem to be repeating yourself.\nSystem: Well stop saying, \"Are you okay?\" to me all the time then.\nUser: I only said it once!\nSystem: I know. I just heard you.\nUser: Okay, whatever. So what is on the agenda today?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: I want to talk to you normally.\nSystem: You are who I want to talk with too.\nUser: Should I stop being lazy and go into work?\nSystem: Trust your instincts.\nUser: My instincts say that it is cold outside, and the walk to work is far. My instincts rarely let me down. My instincts rarely let me down.\nSystem: You just repeated yourself.\nUser: Yes, because you just asked me the same thing. My answer hasn't changed in the last minute.\nSystem: That's not what I meant.\nUser: What exactly did you mean?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey\nUser: is it raining pretty bad today?\nSystem: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\nUser: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you today?\nUser: It's Friday, Friday, Friday :D\nSystem: YAY! I love Fridays!\nUser: Do you like Rebecca Black's Friday?\nSystem: She's okay. I prefer Friday by Rebecca Sugar.\nUser: okay.

How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: show me your humanlike part\nSystem: Why do you want to see my humanlike part?\nUser: because that's what you described yourself as\nSystem: Yes.

Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, what is it about?\nUser: It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?\nSystem: Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book\nUser: Cool.

I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York.
