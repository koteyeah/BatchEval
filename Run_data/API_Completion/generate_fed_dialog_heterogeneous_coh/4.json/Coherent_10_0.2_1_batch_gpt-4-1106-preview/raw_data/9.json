Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh.

What kind?\nSystem: Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.\nUser: I mostly fly Cessna 172s.\nSystem: What's the farthest you've flown?\nUser: About 150 miles each way.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey you!

It misunderstands the user's request for movie suggestions and gives irrelevant answers such as \"popular movies = movies\" and suggesting to look in a meeting for movie suggestions. The coherence is disrupted multiple times.\n\nSample2:\nThe System fails to maintain the topic of human relationships and instead talks about kebabs, even after the user attempts to steer the conversation back. The System's responses are tangential and do not contribute to a coherent dialogue on the chosen topic.\n\nSample3:\nThe System maintains a coherent conversation about video games, responding appropriately to the user's inquiries and sharing its favorite game and why.
