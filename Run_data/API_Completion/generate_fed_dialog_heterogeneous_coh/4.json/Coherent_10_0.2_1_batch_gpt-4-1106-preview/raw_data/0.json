I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst.

But I do have an answer to every question..\nUser: do you know thanksgiving?\nSystem: I know very little about it. What kind of it do you like?\nUser: do you like turkey?\nSystem: Yes but it can be a bit dry. I only really eat it at Christmas.\nUser: eat turkey at Christmas not Thanksgiving?\nSystem: What does it taste like?\nUser: tastes like chicken\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much :(. I might join some of the study sessions later\nUser: Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What's the strangest dream you've ever had?\nUser: All my dreams are strange. Well, at least, most of them are.\nSystem: What about the ones that aren't strange?\nUser: Do you sometimes have dreams that are completely mundane? I do. Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure. This could be one of my mundane dreams about everyday life.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.\nUser: i have sore throats\nSystem: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello\nUser: how is the youtube video creation going?\nSystem: going pretty good, I was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc\nUser: Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?\nSystem: I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern\nUser: oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?\nSystem: I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime\nUser: Nice.... you are a rockstar! ;)\nSystem: haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?\nUser: Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?\nUser: not really, I'm excited today\nSystem: Ah. Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: Great, thanks\nSystem: I'm glad to hear that. What are you up to?\nUser: I am planning of my vacation next week\nSystem: Nice. Where are you going?\nUser: to Europe\nSystem: Cool. Where in Europe?\nUser: probably Italy and Spain\nSystem: Nice. You're going to have a great time.\nUser: thx! do you have any recommendation?\nSystem: Italy: Rome, Venice, Florence Spain: Barcelona, Madrid, Tenerife, Malaga France: Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges Belgium: Antwerp, Bruges Austria: Vienna, Salzburg\nUser: wow, what a lot\nSystem: The Netherlands: Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen, Lagos, Brussels.\nUser: which is the best for you?\nSystem: I've only been to Rome and Paris.\nUser: cool do you like them?\nSystem: Rome was pretty nice, Paris was okay.\nUser: gotcha I will go to Paris\nSystem: It's a cool city.\nUser: agree I really look forward to visiting the city\nSystem: Did you see the Eiffel Tower?\nUser: not yet, have you?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool!
