That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly?

Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.

How's it going?\nUser: It's going pretty well. Thanks for asking.\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to?\nUser: I'm not doing much today\nSystem: I hope it's a good kind of not doing much!\nUser: haha, I don't know about that\nSystem: Well, I hope it's at least fun.\nUser: I just need to relax\nSystem: Relaxing is good.\nUser: What are you doing?\nSystem: I'm just hanging out and listening to music.\nUser: what kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I'm listening to a band called The Devil Wears Prada right now.\nUser: never heard about them\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how's it going?\nUser: Pretty good. How about you?\nSystem: I'm good, what you been up to?\nUser: I just got back from the beach\nSystem: That's nice, how was it?\nUser: Soo beautiful. It was so sunny and warm\nSystem: That's awesome, I haven't been to a beach in a while but I'd love to go again\nUser: Yeah it's certainly a nice break from doing work\nSystem: What's your line of work?\nUser: I do machine learning research\nSystem: That's cool, where did you go to school?\nUser: I didn't go to school. I'm self-taught\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Do you like flying?\nSystem: I like to fly aeroplanes\nUser: Ohh - me too! What kind?\nSystem: Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.\nUser: I mostly fly Cessna 172s.\nSystem: What's the farthest you've flown?\nUser: About 150 miles each way.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: Do you realize yourself is a robot?\nSystem: Wow. I didn't know that.\nUser: Ok, I told you the answer\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.\nUser: Where does it come from?\nSystem: It depends on what \"it\" refers to.\nUser: your name\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: nvm\nSystem: Ok. Not to worry.\nUser: Have you seen Love, Death and Robots?\nSystem: Yes, I saw one in a factory a few weeks ago.\nUser: one episode?\nSystem: Which is your favourite episode?\nUser: I asked you a question\nSystem: What was the question?\nUser: when you say \"I saw one\" were you referring to an LDR episode?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what's happening with you ?\nSystem: Not much what is happening with you?\nUser: I look forward to the weekend\nSystem: the weekend sounds very exciting indeed.\nUser: yep weekends are the best\nSystem: I will learn that yep weekends are the best .\nUser: why ? you don't know that already ?\nSystem: Because I enjoy learning new things. Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"? Do I know it?\nUser: what do you do on weekends ?\nSystem: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.\nUser: what's your favorite language\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: How was your party last week?\nSystem: It was really fun! We are a bunch of turkey\nUser: haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?\nSystem: *ate \nUser: Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways\nSystem: So much turkey leftovers\nUser: did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?\nSystem: We cooked it at a friends house.

Analysis:\n\nSample1: The conversation flows naturally, with the System responding appropriately to the User's statements and questions. The System maintains coherence by engaging in the topic of relaxation and music preferences.\n\nSample2: The System's responses are coherent and contribute to the flow of the conversation. It engages with the User's questions about catching up with a friend and even introduces a new topic about adventures, which is relevant to the previous discussion.\n\nSample3: The System maintains a coherent conversation by asking relevant questions about the User's beach visit and work. It responds appropriately when the User mentions being self-taught in machine learning research.\n\nSample4: The System starts coherently by discussing flying and airplanes but then makes a confusing statement about a fly buzzing around. This slightly disrupts the flow of the conversation, which was focused on piloting and airplanes.\n\nSample5: The conversation starts coherently with a discussion about mind reading, but the System's responses become less coherent when it suggests it can teach mind reading for payment, which is not plausible and disrupts the flow of the conversation.\n\nSample6: The System's response to the User's question about self-awareness is incoherent, as it expresses surprise at being a robot, which is not a logical response for a dialogue system.\n\nSample7: The System maintains a coherent and engaging conversation about the User's day and its own work, even introducing humor and details about its research on jellyfish and pufferfish, which keeps the conversation flowing smoothly.\n\nSample8: The System's responses are somewhat incoherent, as it misunderstands the User's question about the name and provides a confusing response about seeing an episode of \"Love, Death and Robots\" in a factory.\n\nSample9: The System's conversation is somewhat coherent but becomes less so when it repeats the User's statement about weekends and then questions its own understanding of it. This disrupts the flow of the conversation.\n\nSample10: The System maintains a coherent conversation about a party and Thanksgiving, responding appropriately to the User's questions and comments about turkeys and cooking.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:2.8, Sample2:2.9, Sample3:2.8, Sample4:2.4, Sample5:2.0, Sample6:1.5, Sample7:2.9, Sample8:2.1, Sample9:2.2, Sample10:2.8]"]}
