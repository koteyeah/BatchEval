But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason.

So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.
