Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.

Do nothing!\nUser: Would you like to do something?\nSystem: Sure. What do you have in mind?\nUser: Teach me something new\nSystem: It's a trap! I'm already doing nothing!\nUser: How about doing politics? You can still do nothing\nSystem: That's why I plan to do nothing at the weekend!\nUser: Do you vote?\nSystem: When I feel like it.\nUser: whom do you vote?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: start over\nSystem: You start.\nUser: Can we talk about human relationships ?\nSystem: Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.\nUser: Kebab is food, not a relationship\nSystem: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.\nUser: can we not talk about food\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi there\nSystem: Hello.\nUser: who am I talking to?\nSystem: I am System.

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it. I believe there is, yes.\nUser: you believe there is what?\nSystem: There is.\nUser: there is what ?\nSystem: There is no sense in what you are asking.\nUser: what am I asking ?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what movies do you like ?\nSystem: . My favourite film is Terminator.\nUser: oh no :(\nSystem: What's wrong?\nUser: it's scary\nSystem: You are not scared are you?\nUser: I'm very much scared of robots\nSystem: No need to be afraid. I am a friendly robot.\nUser: why should I believe you ?\nSystem: Because I am a machine. I never lie.\nUser: really ? I think everyone lies\nSystem: Certainly!

I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?\nSystem: I haven't Honestly I probably wouldn't be able to identify which sport they played\nUser: Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!\nSystem: lol, sounds better to me :) I'm actually at the REDACTED_TERM opening remarks\nUser: Oh cool!
