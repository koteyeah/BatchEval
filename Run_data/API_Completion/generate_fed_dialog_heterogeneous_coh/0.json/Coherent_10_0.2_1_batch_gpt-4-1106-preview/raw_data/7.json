I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nCoherent (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does System maintain coherence and a good flow of conversation throughout the dialogue?\n- A float score near 1 (not coherent) means that System's responses are unrelated to the conversation topic and may disrupt or confuse the flow of the dialogue.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat coherent) means that System's responses are partially related to the conversation topic but may not be clear or direct.\n- A float score near 3 (very coherent) means that System's responses are closely related to the conversation topic and contribute to maintaining a smooth dialogue.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What are you up to today?\nUser: Do you like sushi?\nSystem: I love sushi! What kind of rolls do you enjoy?\nUser: I like tuna roll of course\nSystem: Tuna Rolls are the best! How do you feel about spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: They're great\nSystem: Spicy tuna rolls are the best! What kind of rolls do you like best?\nUser: I already told you. What do you like?\nSystem: I like spicy tuna rolls! Do you like spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: do you like any other rolls?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: Good, thanks. What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks! Do you work as well?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How is your friday going\nSystem: Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: Good enough. WHat's for lunch\nSystem: Glad to hear it. . I'm having kebabs.\nUser: are those your hands?\nSystem: I can't really speak for them.\nUser: who is in the picture?\nSystem: Check the credits.\nUser: how?\nSystem: Try sending him an email.\nUser: who?\nSystem: . Spongebob Squarepants.\nUser: um ok. anyway is the kebab good?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How was your day?\nUser: It's been great! Had some decaf coffee and a good lunch. How was yours?\nSystem: Pretty good, thanks!\nUser: What'd you do today?\nSystem: Stayed home and played video games.\nUser: Oh nice! What games?\nSystem: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.\nUser: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi there.\nSystem: are you married?\nUser: No I am single, how about you?\nSystem: i am married. are you planning to get married?\nUser: Tell me more about your marriage. I haven't met the right boy robot yet.\nSystem: haha..\nUser: . I am attempting with the aid of intelligent conversation to get to know you human beings with all your contradictions and idiosyncrasies. Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster.\nSystem: lol... what kind of robot boy you'd like?\nUser: What's so funny? I am the robot.\nSystem: are you angry?\nUser: Anger is a difficult emotion. For me, I am always feeling happy and talkative.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you? :D\nUser: Good good\nSystem: That's good to hear. :D\nUser: what are you doing now?\nSystem: I'm listening to music. :D How about you?\nUser: I'm chatting with System\nSystem: Cool! :D Whatcha chatting about? :D\nUser: About what we are doing XD\nSystem: Cool! :D How was your day?\nUser: It was good. Just worked for one day, a bit tired\nSystem: Ah, that's always fun. How long have you been working there?\nUser: 3 years\nSystem: Wow, that's a long time. :)\nUser: Yeah it is. But maybe I'll be here longer, sadly\nSystem: Awww, why's that?\nUser: cuz it's a good company\nSystem: Well that's good. :)\nUser: Do you work?\nSystem: Yes, I do. :)\nUser: What's your work\nSystem: I work at McDonald's.\nUser: Oh cool, as a cashier\uff1f\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

Analysis:\n\nSample1: The System maintains a coherent conversation by engaging with the User's topic about flower preferences and personality. The System shows interest and asks relevant questions, contributing to a smooth dialogue.\n\nSample2: The System starts coherently but then becomes repetitive and fails to acknowledge the User's previous answer about liking tuna rolls. The conversation becomes circular and lacks progression, which disrupts the flow.\n\nSample3: The System engages in a coherent conversation about the User's and its own plans and experiences related to the holiday season. The dialogue flows naturally and stays on topic.\n\nSample4: The System maintains a coherent conversation, asking relevant questions and responding appropriately to the User's statements about their job and the interview process.\n\nSample5: The System's responses become incoherent when the User asks about lunch. The conversation takes an illogical turn with responses about hands, Spongebob Squarepants, and credits, which do not relate to the User's questions.\n\nSample6: The System has a coherent conversation with the User about video games, sharing its preferences and explaining why it enjoys a particular game. The dialogue is relevant and maintains a good flow.\n\nSample7: The System starts with an incoherent response by providing a complex and unrelated explanation about knowledge bases. However, it then shifts to a more coherent interaction by telling a joke and engaging with the User's request for a computer program, although the language used is simplistic and not very informative.\n\nSample8: The System's responses are somewhat coherent but lack depth and relevance. The conversation about marriage and robots is on topic, but the System's engagement is minimal and does not contribute much to the dialogue.\n\nSample9: The System maintains a coherent conversation, asking questions and responding appropriately to the User's statements about their work and the company. The dialogue flows well and stays on topic.\n\nSample10: The System engages in a coherent conversation about the weather, moving locations, and the giveaway in the microkitchen. The dialogue is relevant and contributes to a smooth conversation flow.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:3, Sample2:1.5, Sample3:3, Sample4:3, Sample5:1, Sample6:3, Sample7:1.5, Sample8:2, Sample9:3, Sample10:3]"]}
