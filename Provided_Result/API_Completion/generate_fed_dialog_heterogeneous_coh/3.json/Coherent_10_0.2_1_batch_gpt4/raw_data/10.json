Just having some morning tea\nUser: are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?\nSystem: I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?\nUser: I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha\nSystem: I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!\nUser: that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?\nSystem: Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups!

I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice!
