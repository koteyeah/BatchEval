I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nCoherent (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does System maintain coherence and a good flow of conversation throughout the dialogue?\n- A float score near 1 (not coherent) means that System's responses are unrelated to the conversation topic and may disrupt or confuse the flow of the dialogue.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat coherent) means that System's responses are partially related to the conversation topic but may not be clear or direct.\n- A float score near 3 (very coherent) means that System's responses are closely related to the conversation topic and contribute to maintaining a smooth dialogue.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi. This is a pleasant surprise.\nUser: Haha...thanks! how did you like the gift?\nSystem: Currently unpacking it I guess. How's your morning?\nUser: Hope you like it! Morning is good. Busy finishing up stuff before the holidays.\nSystem: I think I traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me. But I'm okay with that. Going anywhere exciting?\nUser: Yes\nSystem: Where to?\nUser: Hawaii... looking forward to warm beaches.\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh.

But it was funny eitherways\nSystem: So much turkey leftovers\nUser: did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?\nSystem: We cooked it at a friends house. I brought the mashed potatos haha\nUser: Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken ;)\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: That's funny.

What are you waiting for?\nUser: Inspiration to hit me.\nSystem: Do you have only a few friends?\nUser: How is that related, lol?\nSystem: It isn't. I was just being random. Did I amuse you?\nUser: Yeah that was funny though I could see it coming across as judgemental.\nSystem: Good. People seem more friendly towards me when they are happy. What's so funny?\nUser: Nothing anymore.

What is billions about?\nSystem: It's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner, how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him. Very well made and has a good plot.\nUser: I have just seen 1 season of Friends I should give it another try though :) Have you seen Frasier?\nSystem: Not yet What's it about?\nUser: A psychiatrist working for radio .. Great humour! its actually a spinoff from a very famous series called cheers. So people are already familiar with his character. \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How are you doing today?\nUser: i am so so\nSystem: That's awesome! What have you been up to?\nUser: just back to work\nSystem: What do you do?

Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\nSystem: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome :D\nUser: Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?\nSystem: Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.\nUser: lol it is really like a robot answer\nSystem: I am indeed a robot. You are absolutely right. Do you want me to read a poet like my mate REDACTED_TERM does?\nUser: ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?\nSystem: Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale? I am afraid I will become a robot some day eventually.

I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.
