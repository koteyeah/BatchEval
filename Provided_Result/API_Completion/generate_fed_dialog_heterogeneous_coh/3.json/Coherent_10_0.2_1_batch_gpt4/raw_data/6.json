That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?\nSystem: I think ice-cream. It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha\nUser: I love ice cream too!\nSystem: Okay, top three flavors?\nUser: I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?\nSystem: Ah, that's a good way of framing it. Me, I like berries: boysenberry one, strawberry two, maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit.\nUser: Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?\nSystem: Yes. I wonder if I'm in it right now. How would I know? What do you think?\nUser: I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.\nSystem: There's a mental world, I suppose? Understanding itself\nUser: What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What are you up to this evening?\nSystem: I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: What would you like to talk about?\nSystem: My favourite subjects are anything but especially games and football.\nUser: Do you like chess?\nSystem: Yes I love it. Let's play. Pawn to K4.\nUser: Haha sure sure. Pawn to C5\nSystem: I'm just joking with you. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do.\nUser: Oh yeah? Which computers are those?\nSystem: That's interesting. That's alright. Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What is your favorite holiday?\nUser: one where I get to meet lots of different people.\nSystem: What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?\nUser: Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.\nSystem: Which holiday was that?\nUser: I think it was Australia\nSystem: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nUser: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: I'm doing okay, recovering from flu\nSystem: Oh no! Get well soon! :)\nUser: thanks! there's a big flu virus in the US this year\nSystem: No kidding? I hadn't heard that. I hope you feel better soon then! :)\nUser: Thanks! how's life?\nSystem: Life is great! :)\nUser: what are you most passionate about?\nSystem: I'm passionate about making people smile! :)\nUser: haha, everyone needs that!\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: Having fun, but have a bit of a headache How about you?\nUser: I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!\nSystem: Haha, thanks! Never get them, so it's super weird Who's playing?\nUser: Hmm, try taking some REDACTED_TERM! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?\nSystem: I haven't Honestly I probably wouldn't be able to identify which sport they played\nUser: Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!\nSystem: lol, sounds better to me :) I'm actually at the REDACTED_TERM opening remarks\nUser: Oh cool! What is \"NeurIPS\"?\nSystem: Neural Information Processing Systems\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds fancy!

How's it going?\nUser: Hi, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you?\nUser: I'm fine. What's up?\nSystem: Not much. How about you?\nUser: nothing new. Anything exciting happening recently?\nSystem: Not really. You?\nUser: I watched a movie recently which was pretty good\nSystem: That's good. What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive. I know because I just watched it.\nUser: well, the fact you just watched it doesn't mean it was released today\nSystem: That's what I said, I did watch it today.\nUser: ok, I'll put it on my watchlist\nSystem: Let me know what you think of it when you watch it.\nUser: sure, I need to go, nice talking to you\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello\nUser: how is the youtube video creation going?\nSystem: going pretty good, I was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc\nUser: Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?\nSystem: I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern\nUser: oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?\nSystem: I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime\nUser: Nice.... you are a rockstar! ;)\nSystem: haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?\nUser: Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Do you like flying?\nSystem: I like to fly aeroplanes\nUser: Ohh - me too! What kind?\nSystem: Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.\nUser: I mostly fly Cessna 172s.\nSystem: What's the farthest you've flown?\nUser: About 150 miles each way.\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how's it going?\nUser: All good!
