That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?\nSystem: I think ice-cream. It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha\nUser: I love ice cream too!\nSystem: Okay, top three flavors?\nUser: I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?\nSystem: Ah, that's a good way of framing it. Me, I like berries: boysenberry one, strawberry two, maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit.\nUser: Very nice.

Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\nUser: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really?

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.
