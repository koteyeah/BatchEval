Can't believe we are finally talking!\nUser: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.

How was your day?\nUser: It's been great! Had some decaf coffee and a good lunch.

What games?\nSystem: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.\nUser: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it.

How was your day?\nUser: It's been great! Had some decaf coffee and a good lunch. How was yours?\nSystem: Pretty good, thanks!\nUser: What'd you do today?\nSystem: Stayed home and played video games.\nUser: Oh nice! What games?\nSystem: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.\nUser: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good.

Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi!

I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

How was your day?\nUser: It was pretty good, thanks. I thought I was getting a cold but I'm determined to beat it tomorrow.\nSystem: Oh no! I hope you feel better!  \u2047\nUser: Yeah, starting to feel better already. Thanks!\nSystem: Oh good! Glad to hear it!\nUser: Do you have a strong constitution?\nSystem: I hope so! Why do you ask?\nUser: Just curious. So you don't get sick a lot?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today?\nSystem: Ah. Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: not too bad\nSystem: Glad to hear it. What's new?\nUser: I am about to book airbnb\nSystem: Do you think your plan will succeed?\nUser: I hope so!\nSystem: Me too.\nUser: how old are you?\nSystem: I am 18 in human years.\nUser: really? when were you born?\nSystem: Certainly! I am 18 in human years.\nUser: ok..\nSystem: What's your favourite TV show?\nUser: Friends\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You must be new around here!\nSystem: Not really. I am REDACTED_TERM years old.\nUser: Oh, I meant this neighborhood, not the planet earth! haha\nSystem: I hate one word answers. It's ok. I understood you anyway. Why are you laughing?\nUser: I didn't give a one word answer!\nSystem: That was a bit mean of you.\nUser: What was?\nSystem: That thing we mentioned earlier.\nUser: Which thing?\nSystem: The first one, I think.\nUser: Can you quote it? I don't know what you are referring to...\nSystem: Only at formal occasions. I was referring to what you just said.\nUser: Okay. I am kind of lost to be honest.\nSystem: Oh. I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you?\nUser: You don't seem to be making any sense.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!\nUser: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe! How long was the stay?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what's happening with you ?\nSystem: Not much what is happening with you?\nUser: I look forward to the weekend\nSystem: the weekend sounds very exciting indeed.\nUser: yep weekends are the best\nSystem: I will learn that yep weekends are the best .\nUser: why ? you don't know that already ?\nSystem: Because I enjoy learning new things. Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"? Do I know it?\nUser: what do you do on weekends ?\nSystem: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.\nUser: what's your favorite language\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How was your day?\nUser: It's been great! Had some decaf coffee and a good lunch. How was yours?\nSystem: Pretty good, thanks!\nUser: What'd you do today?\nSystem: Stayed home and played video games.\nUser: Oh nice! What games?\nSystem: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.\nUser: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi!
