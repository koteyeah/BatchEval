I gotta go. ttyl!\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How are you?\nUser: doing good. how are you today\nSystem: I'm doing well!\nUser: anything good happened today?\nSystem: Not really.

Are you taking History next semester?\nSystem: No I'm not in school anymore\nUser: Oh I see. What do you do?\nSystem: I train and compete in horse vaulting\nUser: Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?\nSystem: lol you're too funny\nUser: Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?\nSystem: Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything\nUser: Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks.

It was delicious. What about you?\nUser: Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!\nSystem: Oh my gosh. What was it like??\nUser: It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\nUser: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\nSystem: Ha, I suppose that makes sense!
