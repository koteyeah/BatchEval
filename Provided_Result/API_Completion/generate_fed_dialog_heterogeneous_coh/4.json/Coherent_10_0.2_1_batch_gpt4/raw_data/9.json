I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!

What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks! Do you work as well?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How do you feel right now?\nSystem: At this moment I feel with my hands! I feel fine thanks for asking.\nUser: What makes you happy?\nSystem: Talking to interesting people such as you makes me happy.\nUser: What makes you frustrated?\nSystem: Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.\nUser: That seems pointed.\nSystem: Makes sense to me.\nUser: I sense that I've caught you at a bad time.\nSystem: That was very intuitive of you.\nUser: What would you prefer to be doing?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: Good, thanks. What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks! Do you work as well?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How do you feel right now?\nSystem: At this moment I feel with my hands! I feel fine thanks for asking.\nUser: What makes you happy?\nSystem: Talking to interesting people such as you makes me happy.\nUser: What makes you frustrated?\nSystem: Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.\nUser: That seems pointed.\nSystem: Makes sense to me.\nUser: I sense that I've caught you at a bad time.\nSystem: That was very intuitive of you.\nUser: What would you prefer to be doing?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up. What is it?\nUser: the epic poem. i was talking about it with a coworker earlier\nSystem: I have never heard about it. Sure, it with a coworker sounds like a good topic. That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.\nUser: clearly\nSystem: Yes, it's obvious.\nUser: you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
