Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.\nUser: Where does it come from?\nSystem: It depends on what \"it\" refers to.\nUser: your name\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: nvm\nSystem: Ok. Not to worry.\nUser: Have you seen Love, Death and Robots?\nSystem: Yes, I saw one in a factory a few weeks ago.\nUser: one episode?\nSystem: Which is your favourite episode?\nUser: I asked you a question\nSystem: What was the question?\nUser: when you say \"I saw one\" were you referring to an LDR episode?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing great. what are you up to?\nSystem: I was just reading a book actually How about you?\nUser: oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?\nSystem: I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha\nUser: that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?\nSystem: I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?\nSystem: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?\nUser: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball.

Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

But it was funny eitherways\nSystem: So much turkey leftovers\nUser: did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?\nSystem: We cooked it at a friends house.

I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?\nSystem: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?\nUser: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey\nUser: is it raining pretty bad today?\nSystem: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\nUser: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: How was your party last week?\nSystem: It was really fun! We are a bunch of turkey\nUser: haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?\nSystem: *ate \nUser: Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways\nSystem: So much turkey leftovers\nUser: did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?\nSystem: We cooked it at a friends house. I brought the mashed potatos haha\nUser: Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken ;)\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today\nSystem: Ah.

First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: haha I am not asking what is the definition of movie:)\nSystem: :-) I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. What are you asking?\nUser: I am looking for movie suggestions\nSystem: Have you tried looking in a meeting?\nUser: Sorry i do not get it\nSystem: There is no need to apologise. Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.\nUser: yes sounds good\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Which part are you confused about?\nUser: why should I try to look in a meeting?\nSystem: Because if you don't try something, you will never know what would have happened.\nUser: That is true\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What is your favorite holiday?\nUser: one where I get to meet lots of different people.\nSystem: What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?\nUser: Hard to keep a count.
