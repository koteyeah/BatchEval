I still find it difficult to run long races\nUser: I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?\nSystem: I think a triathalon would be cool\nUser: I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons\nSystem: I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?\nUser: It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!

Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community.
