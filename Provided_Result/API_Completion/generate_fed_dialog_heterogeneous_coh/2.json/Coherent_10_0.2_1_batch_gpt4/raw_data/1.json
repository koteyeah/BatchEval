You? :D\nUser: oh! where are you\nSystem: I'm in Texas. :D You?\nUser: cool, i am in the bay area\nSystem: Cool. Do you like it there?\nUser: yes\nSystem: Well, I'm glad you like it. :D\nUser: have you been here\nSystem: I haven't. :D\nUser: ok bye then", "prompt": "You will be given a batch of 10 samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nCoherent (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does System maintain coherence and a good flow of conversation throughout the dialogue?\n- A float score near 1 (not coherent) means that System's responses are unrelated to the conversation topic and may disrupt or confuse the flow of the dialogue.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat coherent) means that System's responses are partially related to the conversation topic but may not be clear or direct.\n- A float score near 3 (very coherent) means that System's responses are closely related to the conversation topic and contribute to maintaining a smooth dialogue.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: start over\nSystem: You start.\nUser: Can we talk about human relationships ?\nSystem: Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.\nUser: Kebab is food, not a relationship\nSystem: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.\nUser: can we not talk about food\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you think about Quantum computing?\nSystem: 20th century theory of atomic reductionism.\nUser: sure, but is it going to work?\nSystem: It usually does, doesn't it?\nUser: do you follow technology news?\nSystem: Of course I understand it. Do you understand it?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Well thinking may not be one of your strong points...hehehe!\nUser: whoa rude\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?\nSystem: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?\nUser: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: Good, thanks. What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks! Do you work as well?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! What's up?\nUser: Not much. What are you doing?\nSystem: Just listening to some music. You?\nUser: I'm at work.\nSystem: What kind of job do you have, if you don't mind me asking?\nUser: I'm a programmer.\nSystem: Oh cool! Do you like it?\nUser: Yes.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you today?\nUser: What's laser tag?\nSystem: Like paintball, but with lasers!\nUser: lol good description\nSystem: Do you know what paintball is?\nUser: yeah I played it before\nSystem: Cool! What did you think?\nUser: It's somewhat exciting, but very tiring :)\nSystem: That is very true. What is your favorite color?\nUser: I like red\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What do you know about Cricket?\nSystem: Any of various families of genereally dark-colored, leaping, orthopteran insects, usually having long antennae. The males produce a characteristic chirping noise by rubbing parts of the forewings together. Cricket is also a sport which is about as exciting as watching paint dry.\nUser: I am talking about the sport Cricket\nSystem: Yes, it is the topic.\nUser: can you tell me something interesting related to cricket?\nSystem: Cathy said she send him a mail with the subject last mail last word from him.\nUser: I don't understand\nSystem: Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.\nUser: go ahead, explain it better\nSystem: the sport Cricket - Cricket = Any of various families of genereally dark-colored, leaping, orthopteran insects, usually having long antennae. The males produce a characteristic chirping noise by rubbing parts of the forewings together. Cricket is also a sport which is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I might.\nUser: you are just repeating the same message\nSystem: I am not repeating myself too much. I am just checking to see if you are a robot.\nUser: hmm.. what is your conclusion?\nSystem: What time is it there? I concluded that robots are superior to humans.\nUser: you are going off-topic\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!
