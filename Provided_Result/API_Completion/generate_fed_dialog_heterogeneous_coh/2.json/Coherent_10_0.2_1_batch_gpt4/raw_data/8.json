I've visited India before.\nSystem: Hyderabad, it is a beautiful city in the southern part of India. Which cities have you gone to in India?\nUser: Hyderabad! and Bangalore! Great food in both cities! Is it still hot this time of year?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know.

It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure.

Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure. This could be one of my mundane dreams about everyday life.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you\nSystem: I am fine, thank you. Yourself?\nUser: I'm not feeling well\nSystem: Why what's wrong?\nUser: I'm sleepy\nSystem: Better get some rest.\nUser: yeah, I hope so\nSystem: I'm full of good advice.

How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience.

Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's.

Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job. Your job is what are the other ways that people can write Hmm.\nUser: okie System, your rules don't seem to work very well\nSystem: What about my rules do not work WELL?\nUser: alright.

What's getting you down?\nSystem: The clouds overhead are playing on your mind, any plans for the coming vacations?\nUser: I'm thinking of going to visit my family. How about you?\nSystem: Was thinking the same, where does your family live?\nUser: They're in New York. How about yours?\nSystem: Mine is in India, it is a long way away.\nUser: Ahh what city? I've visited India before.\nSystem: Hyderabad, it is a beautiful city in the southern part of India. Which cities have you gone to in India?\nUser: Hyderabad! and Bangalore! Great food in both cities! Is it still hot this time of year?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?\nUser: not really, I'm excited today\nSystem: Ah. Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What's the strangest dream you've ever had?\nUser: All my dreams are strange. Well, at least, most of them are.\nSystem: What about the ones that aren't strange?\nUser: Do you sometimes have dreams that are completely mundane? I do. Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure. This could be one of my mundane dreams about everyday life.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you\nSystem: I am fine, thank you. Yourself?\nUser: I'm not feeling well\nSystem: Why what's wrong?\nUser: I'm sleepy\nSystem: Better get some rest.\nUser: yeah, I hope so\nSystem: I'm full of good advice.

Better get some rest.\nUser: I will\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hi\nUser: what are you up to?\nSystem: code refactoring. you?\nUser: me? just chilling out at work. what is code refactoring?\nSystem: good question.
