What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What are you up to this evening?\nSystem: I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: What would you like to talk about?\nSystem: My favourite subjects are anything but especially games and football.\nUser: Do you like chess?\nSystem: Yes I love it.

I don't play chess but I know some computers who do.\nUser: Oh yeah? Which computers are those?\nSystem: That's interesting. That's alright. Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures.
