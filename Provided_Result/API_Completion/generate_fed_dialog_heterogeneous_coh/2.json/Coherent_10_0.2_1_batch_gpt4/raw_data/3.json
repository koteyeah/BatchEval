What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey you!

It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\nUser: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\nSystem: Ha, I suppose that makes sense!
