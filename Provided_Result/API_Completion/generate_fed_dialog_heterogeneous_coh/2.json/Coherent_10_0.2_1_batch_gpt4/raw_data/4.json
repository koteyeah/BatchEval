Did I clear things up for you?\nUser: nope, because you haven't answered my question\nSystem: Fair enough. I thought I possibly did but I guess I was mistaken. I did but I was just giving sarcastic replies.\nUser: do you remember my original request?\nSystem: Is this a trick question?\nUser: nope, it's a memory question\nSystem: It seems like a trick to me. Perhaps there is a memory answer?\nUser: okay, I try again, say something human-like to me\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!\nUser: how's week so far?\nSystem: pretty good, excited for thanksgiving you?\nUser: Same.

Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"? Do I know it?\nUser: what do you do on weekends ?\nSystem: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.\nUser: what's your favorite language\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Sorry I'm late!

I only know countries, not towns or cities.\nUser: Do more people live in the USA or Australia?\nSystem: Not that much more, no.\nUser: What other subjects do you know about besides Geography?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool!
