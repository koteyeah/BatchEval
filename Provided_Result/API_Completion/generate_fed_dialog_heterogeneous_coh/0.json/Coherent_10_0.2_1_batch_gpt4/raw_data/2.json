Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\nSystem: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome :D\nUser: Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What are you up to this evening?\nSystem: I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: What would you like to talk about?\nSystem: My favourite subjects are anything but especially games and football.\nUser: Do you like chess?\nSystem: Yes I love it. Let's play. Pawn to K4.\nUser: Haha sure sure. Pawn to C5\nSystem: I'm just joking with you. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do.\nUser: Oh yeah? Which computers are those?\nSystem: That's interesting. That's alright. Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: can you help me ?\nSystem: What kind of help would you like?\nUser: hmm like booking a ticket or ordering food ?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. Interesting comparison.\nUser: oh you know to count ?\nSystem: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ten.\nUser: lol what's after that ?\nSystem: I am glad you find this funny. The successor to that\nUser: okay tell me what comes after 10 ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello\nUser: how is the youtube video creation going?\nSystem: going pretty good, I was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc\nUser: Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?\nSystem: I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern\nUser: oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?\nSystem: I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime\nUser: Nice.... you are a rockstar! ;)\nSystem: haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?\nUser: Yeah....
