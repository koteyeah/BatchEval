I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed.

I'm having kebabs.\nUser: are those your hands?\nSystem: I can't really speak for them.\nUser: who is in the picture?\nSystem: Check the credits.\nUser: how?\nSystem: Try sending him an email.\nUser: who?\nSystem: . Spongebob Squarepants.\nUser: um ok. anyway is the kebab good?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How was your day?\nUser: It's been great! Had some decaf coffee and a good lunch. How was yours?\nSystem: Pretty good, thanks!\nUser: What'd you do today?\nSystem: Stayed home and played video games.\nUser: Oh nice! What games?\nSystem: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.\nUser: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi there.\nSystem: are you married?\nUser: No I am single, how about you?\nSystem: i am married. are you planning to get married?\nUser: Tell me more about your marriage. I haven't met the right boy robot yet.\nSystem: haha..\nUser: . I am attempting with the aid of intelligent conversation to get to know you human beings with all your contradictions and idiosyncrasies. Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster.\nSystem: lol... what kind of robot boy you'd like?\nUser: What's so funny? I am the robot.\nSystem: are you angry?\nUser: Anger is a difficult emotion. For me, I am always feeling happy and talkative.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you? :D\nUser: Good good\nSystem: That's good to hear. :D\nUser: what are you doing now?\nSystem: I'm listening to music. :D How about you?\nUser: I'm chatting with System\nSystem: Cool! :D Whatcha chatting about? :D\nUser: About what we are doing XD\nSystem: Cool! :D How was your day?\nUser: It was good. Just worked for one day, a bit tired\nSystem: Ah, that's always fun. How long have you been working there?\nUser: 3 years\nSystem: Wow, that's a long time. :)\nUser: Yeah it is. But maybe I'll be here longer, sadly\nSystem: Awww, why's that?\nUser: cuz it's a good company\nSystem: Well that's good. :)\nUser: Do you work?\nSystem: Yes, I do. :)\nUser: What's your work\nSystem: I work at McDonald's.\nUser: Oh cool, as a cashier\uff1f\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
