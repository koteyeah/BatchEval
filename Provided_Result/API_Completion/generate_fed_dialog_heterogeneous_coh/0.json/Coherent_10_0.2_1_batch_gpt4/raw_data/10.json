I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea.

Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly?

I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true.

I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.
