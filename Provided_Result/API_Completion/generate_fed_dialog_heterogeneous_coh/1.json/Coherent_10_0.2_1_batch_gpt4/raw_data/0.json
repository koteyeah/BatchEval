That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?\nSystem: I think ice-cream. It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha\nUser: I love ice cream too!\nSystem: Okay, top three flavors?\nUser: I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?\nSystem: Ah, that's a good way of framing it. Me, I like berries: boysenberry one, strawberry two, maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit.\nUser: Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?\nSystem: Yes. I wonder if I'm in it right now. How would I know? What do you think?\nUser: I think so.

Do you want me to read a poet like my mate REDACTED_TERM does?\nUser: ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?\nSystem: Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale? I am afraid I will become a robot some day eventually.

Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what movies do you like ?\nSystem: .
