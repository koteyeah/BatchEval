It shows interest in the user's book and asks relevant questions.\n\nSample3: The system is very coherent in this conversation. It responds directly to the user's questions and maintains the flow of the conversation. It even recommends a book to the user.\n\nSample4: The system's responses are coherent and maintain the flow of the conversation. However, it seems to be confused about its identity, as it talks about having a degree in biology and wanting to get a PhD, which is not possible for a dialogue system.\n\nSample5: The system's responses are not coherent. It doesn't respond directly to the user's statements and questions. For example, when the user talks about slamming into an ice wall, the system responds with \"a resort in Montreal\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nSample6: The system's responses are not coherent. It doesn't provide a useful suggestion for the user's party and its responses are confusing and unrelated to the conversation.\n\nSample7: The system's responses are somewhat coherent. It responds directly to the user's questions, but it doesn't seem to understand that it is a robot.\n\nSample8: The system's responses are coherent and maintain the flow of the conversation. It shows interest in the user's experiences and asks relevant questions.\n\nSample9: The system's responses are coherent and maintain the flow of the conversation. It responds directly to the user's questions about programming languages.\n\nSample10: The system's responses are somewhat coherent. It responds directly to the user's questions, but it doesn't provide useful advice about buying and selling stocks.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:1.5, Sample2:3, Sample3:3, Sample4:2.5, Sample5:1.5, Sample6:1, Sample7:2, Sample8:3, Sample9:3, Sample10:2]"]}
