Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: How was your party last week?\nSystem: It was really fun! We are a bunch of turkey\nUser: haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?\nSystem: *ate \nUser: Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways\nSystem: So much turkey leftovers\nUser: did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?\nSystem: We cooked it at a friends house. I brought the mashed potatos haha\nUser: Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken ;)\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how's it going?\nUser: All good! It's cold\nSystem: It's pretty cold here too.\nUser: where do you stay?\nSystem: Wisconsin. How about you?\nUser: San Jose, Cali\nSystem: Oh nice! I've always wanted to go to Cali.\nUser: Have you been here before?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Do you like flying?\nSystem: I like to fly aeroplanes\nUser: Ohh - me too! What kind?\nSystem: Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.\nUser: I mostly fly Cessna 172s.\nSystem: What's the farthest you've flown?\nUser: About 150 miles each way.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: any improvements in your marathon time?\nSystem: No, only a few minutes. I still find it difficult to run long races\nUser: I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?\nSystem: I think a triathalon would be cool\nUser: I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons\nSystem: I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?\nUser: It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What's the strangest dream you've ever had?\nUser: All my dreams are strange.

It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.

I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly?

It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.

I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly?

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting!

Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nCoherent (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does System maintain coherence and a good flow of conversation throughout the dialogue?\n- A float score near 1 (not coherent) means that System's responses are unrelated to the conversation topic and may disrupt or confuse the flow of the dialogue.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat coherent) means that System's responses are partially related to the conversation topic but may not be clear or direct.\n- A float score near 3 (very coherent) means that System's responses are closely related to the conversation topic and contribute to maintaining a smooth dialogue.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: pretty good. yours?\nUser: Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..\nSystem: oh what happened?\nUser: Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')\nSystem: hahah wait for real?\nUser: I know right! Are you taking History next semester?\nSystem: No I'm not in school anymore\nUser: Oh I see. What do you do?\nSystem: I train and compete in horse vaulting\nUser: Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?\nSystem: lol you're too funny\nUser: Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?\nSystem: Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything\nUser: Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: How was your party last week?\nSystem: It was really fun! We are a bunch of turkey\nUser: haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?\nSystem: *ate \nUser: Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways\nSystem: So much turkey leftovers\nUser: did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?\nSystem: We cooked it at a friends house. I brought the mashed potatos haha\nUser: Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken ;)\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how's it going?\nUser: All good! It's cold\nSystem: It's pretty cold here too.\nUser: where do you stay?\nSystem: Wisconsin. How about you?\nUser: San Jose, Cali\nSystem: Oh nice! I've always wanted to go to Cali.\nUser: Have you been here before?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Do you like flying?\nSystem: I like to fly aeroplanes\nUser: Ohh - me too! What kind?\nSystem: Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.\nUser: I mostly fly Cessna 172s.\nSystem: What's the farthest you've flown?\nUser: About 150 miles each way.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: any improvements in your marathon time?\nSystem: No, only a few minutes. I still find it difficult to run long races\nUser: I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?\nSystem: I think a triathalon would be cool\nUser: I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons\nSystem: I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?\nUser: It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What's the strangest dream you've ever had?\nUser: All my dreams are strange. Well, at least, most of them are.\nSystem: What about the ones that aren't strange?\nUser: Do you sometimes have dreams that are completely mundane? I do. Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure. This could be one of my mundane dreams about everyday life.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You must be new around here!\nSystem: Not really. I am REDACTED_TERM years old.\nUser: Oh, I meant this neighborhood, not the planet earth! haha\nSystem: I hate one word answers. It's ok. I understood you anyway. Why are you laughing?\nUser: I didn't give a one word answer!\nSystem: That was a bit mean of you.\nUser: What was?\nSystem: That thing we mentioned earlier.\nUser: Which thing?\nSystem: The first one, I think.\nUser: Can you quote it? I don't know what you are referring to...\nSystem: Only at formal occasions. I was referring to what you just said.\nUser: Okay. I am kind of lost to be honest.\nSystem: Oh. I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you?\nUser: You don't seem to be making any sense.\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today?\nSystem: Ah. Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: not too bad\nSystem: Glad to hear it.
