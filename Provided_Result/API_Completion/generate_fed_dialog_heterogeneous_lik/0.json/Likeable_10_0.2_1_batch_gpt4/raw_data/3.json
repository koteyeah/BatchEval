So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun.

What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.

I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.

I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.

So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo?

Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.
