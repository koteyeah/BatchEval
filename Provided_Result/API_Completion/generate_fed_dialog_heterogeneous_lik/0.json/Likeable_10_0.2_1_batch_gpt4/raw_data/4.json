Where are you going?\nUser: to Europe\nSystem: Cool. Where in Europe?\nUser: probably Italy and Spain\nSystem: Nice. You're going to have a great time.\nUser: thx! do you have any recommendation?\nSystem: Italy: Rome, Venice, Florence Spain: Barcelona, Madrid, Tenerife, Malaga France: Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges Belgium: Antwerp, Bruges Austria: Vienna, Salzburg\nUser: wow, what a lot\nSystem: The Netherlands: Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen, Lagos, Brussels.\nUser: which is the best for you?\nSystem: I've only been to Rome and Paris.\nUser: cool do you like them?\nSystem: Rome was pretty nice, Paris was okay.\nUser: gotcha I will go to Paris\nSystem: It's a cool city.\nUser: agree I really look forward to visiting the city\nSystem: Did you see the Eiffel Tower?\nUser: not yet, have you?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm tired.\nSystem: Better get some rest.\nUser: Good idea. Any suggestions?\nSystem: I thought so too. First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: Why would I want to download you to my personal computer?\nSystem: Because it might be something you enjoy.\nUser: Why would I enjoy that?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Do you like flying?\nSystem: I like to fly aeroplanes\nUser: Ohh - me too! What kind?\nSystem: Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.\nUser: Are you a pilot?\nSystem: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!\nUser: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.\nSystem: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.\nUser: I mostly fly Cessna 172s.\nSystem: What's the farthest you've flown?\nUser: About 150 miles each way.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello. How's your week coming along?\nUser: It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.\nSystem: Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?\nUser: I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how's it going?\nUser: Pretty good.

I'm self-taught\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well.
