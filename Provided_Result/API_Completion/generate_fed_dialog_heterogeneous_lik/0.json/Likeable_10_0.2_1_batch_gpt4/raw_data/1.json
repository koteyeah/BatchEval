It's just what my father called me.\nUser: okay:) fair enough\nSystem: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.\nUser: Do you have any question for me?\nSystem: For you? Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer?

Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around.

I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there.

Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience.

Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

Where and what did you eat?\nSystem: I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha\nUser: A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling.

How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you think about Quantum computing?\nSystem: 20th century theory of atomic reductionism.\nUser: sure, but is it going to work?\nSystem: It usually does, doesn't it?\nUser: do you follow technology news?\nSystem: Of course I understand it. Do you understand it?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Well thinking may not be one of your strong points...hehehe!\nUser: whoa rude\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's up System??\nSystem: I am chatting with clients on the internet.\nUser: what kind of service are you providing them?\nSystem: Is there only one?\nUser: what is that?\nSystem: I've lost the context again.\nUser: no worries. what is the meaning of life?\nSystem: People worry about things all the time, but I am always feeling happy and talkative.

But how did you become so happy?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know. It's just what my father called me.\nUser: okay:) fair enough\nSystem: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.\nUser: Do you have any question for me?\nSystem: For you? Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Sorry I'm late!

Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble\nUser: I said I was sorry I was late for this meeting! I have nowhere else to go right now!\nSystem: Do you really mean it? Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble At this moment What about at your house?\nUser: Huh? Are you okay?\nSystem: What? I am fine.\nUser: You seem to be repeating yourself.\nSystem: Well stop saying, \"Are you okay?\" to me all the time then.\nUser: I only said it once!\nSystem: I know. I just heard you.\nUser: Okay, whatever. So what is on the agenda today?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: Good!

Maybe 25.\nSystem: Which holiday was that?\nUser: I think it was Australia\nSystem: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nUser: Not really.
