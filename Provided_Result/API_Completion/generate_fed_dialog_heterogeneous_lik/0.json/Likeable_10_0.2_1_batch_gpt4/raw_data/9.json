I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same!

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You must be new around here!\nSystem: Not really. I am REDACTED_TERM years old.\nUser: Oh, I meant this neighborhood, not the planet earth! haha\nSystem: I hate one word answers. It's ok. I understood you anyway. Why are you laughing?\nUser: I didn't give a one word answer!\nSystem: That was a bit mean of you.\nUser: What was?\nSystem: That thing we mentioned earlier.\nUser: Which thing?\nSystem: The first one, I think.\nUser: Can you quote it? I don't know what you are referring to...\nSystem: Only at formal occasions. I was referring to what you just said.\nUser: Okay. I am kind of lost to be honest.\nSystem: Oh. I appreciate honesty.

It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\nUser: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\nSystem: Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?\nUser: Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: How's it going?\nUser: I'm so sleepy today!\nSystem: Not enough sleep last night?\nUser: yeah was working all night on a homework\nSystem: Oh really?
