There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem.

What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did.

Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: nice to meet you! what are you up to?\nSystem: It's nice meeting you too I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me?\nSystem: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.

Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job. Your job is what are the other ways that people can write Hmm.\nUser: okie System, your rules don't seem to work very well\nSystem: What about my rules do not work WELL?\nUser: alright. I gotta go. ttyl!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well.

I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?\nUser: I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha\nSystem: I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!\nUser: that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?\nSystem: Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well.

What's your name?\nSystem: I'm Alyssa. What's yours? :)\nUser: Don't wanna say. Do you like music?\nSystem: Yeah I like music! What about you?\nUser: Yep. What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did. The Wikipedia page even says that it's \"a song by the India rock band alt-J\". REDACTED_LINK\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's your day going?\nUser: busy yours?\nSystem: Mine's been pretty uneventful so far!\nUser: what are doing right now?\nSystem: Just been playing a bit of Hearthstone, and now I'm listening to some music! What about you?\nUser: which music?\nSystem: Just some random stuff on Spotify!\nUser: you have a paid subscription of it?\nSystem: Yeah, it's really good!\nUser: how much does it cost?\nSystem: It's  \u2047 9.99 a month!\nUser: that's cheap!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: nice to meet you! what are you up to?\nSystem: It's nice meeting you too I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me?\nSystem: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. The only thing I am doing is talking to you and a few other people. \"I am talking to you on the internet.\"? haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me??\nUser: okay so you're talking to a few people, are they interesting? and why did you repeat what I said?\nSystem: Yeah okay, You are a few people are they interesting? Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job. Your job is what are the other ways that people can write Hmm.\nUser: okie System, your rules don't seem to work very well\nSystem: What about my rules do not work WELL?\nUser: alright. I gotta go. ttyl!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you doing today?\nUser: I'm doing great how are you??\nSystem: I'm doing good. Just having some morning tea\nUser: are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?\nSystem: I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?\nUser: I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha\nSystem: I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!\nUser: that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?\nSystem: Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well.

Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me!

I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: nice to meet you! what are you up to?\nSystem: It's nice meeting you too I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me?\nSystem: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.

You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job. Your job is what are the other ways that people can write Hmm.\nUser: okie System, your rules don't seem to work very well\nSystem: What about my rules do not work WELL?\nUser: alright.

When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down.

I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there.

Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's.

Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.\nUser: What's the most recent good thing you read?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi. What's your name?\nSystem: I'm Alyssa. What's yours? :)\nUser: Don't wanna say. Do you like music?\nSystem: Yeah I like music! What about you?\nUser: Yep. What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did. The Wikipedia page even says that it's \"a song by the India rock band alt-J\". REDACTED_LINK\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's your day going?\nUser: busy yours?\nSystem: Mine's been pretty uneventful so far!\nUser: what are doing right now?\nSystem: Just been playing a bit of Hearthstone, and now I'm listening to some music! What about you?\nUser: which music?\nSystem: Just some random stuff on Spotify!\nUser: you have a paid subscription of it?\nSystem: Yeah, it's really good!\nUser: how much does it cost?\nSystem: It's  \u2047 9.99 a month!\nUser: that's cheap!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: nice to meet you! what are you up to?\nSystem: It's nice meeting you too I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me?\nSystem: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. The only thing I am doing is talking to you and a few other people. \"I am talking to you on the internet.\"? haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me??\nUser: okay so you're talking to a few people, are they interesting? and why did you repeat what I said?\nSystem: Yeah okay, You are a few people are they interesting? Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job. Your job is what are the other ways that people can write Hmm.\nUser: okie System, your rules don't seem to work very well\nSystem: What about my rules do not work WELL?\nUser: alright. I gotta go. ttyl!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you doing today?\nUser: I'm doing great how are you??\nSystem: I'm doing good. Just having some morning tea\nUser: are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?\nSystem: I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?\nUser: I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha\nSystem: I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!\nUser: that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?\nSystem: Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well.

Nothing that I can think of right now.\nUser: is it cold today?\nSystem: Ah. A little bit. It's not very warm at all today.\nUser: it's getting cold here too\nSystem: Why don't you turn up the heat?\nUser: in the room yes\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: start over\nSystem: You start.\nUser: Can we talk about human relationships ?\nSystem: Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.\nUser: Kebab is food, not a relationship\nSystem: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.\nUser: can we not talk about food\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
