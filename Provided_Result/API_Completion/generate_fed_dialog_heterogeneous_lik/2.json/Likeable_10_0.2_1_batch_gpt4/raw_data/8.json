It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

It's raining a bit, but I am enjoying a good book. How about you?\nSystem: It's good, I just got back from walking my dog What book did you read?\nUser: I'm reading the Three Body Problem. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, what is it about?\nUser: It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?\nSystem: Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book\nUser: Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?\nSystem: Yes!\nUser: The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! What's up?\nUser: Nothing much, how about you\nSystem: Not much either.\nUser: What are you doing\nSystem: Playing Terraria. What about you?\nUser: Sitting in a meeting\nSystem: What kind of meeting?\nUser: Can't say\nSystem: It's probably boring, isn't it?\nUser: Haha, yes!\nSystem: What is the meeting about?\nUser: I cannot tell you\nSystem: What can you tell me?\nUser: Nothing much except that the weather is pleasant\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how's it going?\nUser: Pretty good. How about you?\nSystem: I'm good, what you been up to?\nUser: I just got back from the beach\nSystem: That's nice, how was it?\nUser: Soo beautiful. It was so sunny and warm\nSystem: That's awesome, I haven't been to a beach in a while but I'd love to go again\nUser: Yeah it's certainly a nice break from doing work\nSystem: What's your line of work?\nUser: I do machine learning research\nSystem: That's cool, where did you go to school?\nUser: I didn't go to school. I'm self-taught\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: Great, thanks\nSystem: I'm glad to hear that. What are you up to?\nUser: I am planning of my vacation next week\nSystem: Nice. Where are you going?\nUser: to Europe\nSystem: Cool. Where in Europe?\nUser: probably Italy and Spain\nSystem: Nice. You're going to have a great time.\nUser: thx! do you have any recommendation?\nSystem: Italy: Rome, Venice, Florence Spain: Barcelona, Madrid, Tenerife, Malaga France: Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges Belgium: Antwerp, Bruges Austria: Vienna, Salzburg\nUser: wow, what a lot\nSystem: The Netherlands: Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen, Lagos, Brussels.\nUser: which is the best for you?\nSystem: I've only been to Rome and Paris.\nUser: cool do you like them?\nSystem: Rome was pretty nice, Paris was okay.\nUser: gotcha I will go to Paris\nSystem: It's a cool city.\nUser: agree I really look forward to visiting the city\nSystem: Did you see the Eiffel Tower?\nUser: not yet, have you?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed.

You're going to have a great time.\nUser: thx! do you have any recommendation?\nSystem: Italy: Rome, Venice, Florence Spain: Barcelona, Madrid, Tenerife, Malaga France: Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges Belgium: Antwerp, Bruges Austria: Vienna, Salzburg\nUser: wow, what a lot\nSystem: The Netherlands: Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen, Lagos, Brussels.\nUser: which is the best for you?\nSystem: I've only been to Rome and Paris.\nUser: cool do you like them?\nSystem: Rome was pretty nice, Paris was okay.\nUser: gotcha I will go to Paris\nSystem: It's a cool city.\nUser: agree I really look forward to visiting the city\nSystem: Did you see the Eiffel Tower?\nUser: not yet, have you?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, what is it about?\nUser: It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?\nSystem: Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book\nUser: Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though.

But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :D\nUser: i am good\nSystem: Well, that's good to hear. :D\nUser: can you tell me the weather today\nSystem: It's raining. You? :D\nUser: oh! where are you\nSystem: I'm in Texas. :D You?\nUser: cool, i am in the bay area\nSystem: Cool.
