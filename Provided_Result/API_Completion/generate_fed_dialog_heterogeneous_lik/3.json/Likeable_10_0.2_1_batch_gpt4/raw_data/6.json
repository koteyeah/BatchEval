Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community.

I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice!

Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it.

How are you?\nUser: I am good\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good! What are you supposed to be doing right now?\nUser: Helping collect some data for training models.\nSystem: Ooh, what kind of training models?\nUser: Models that will help improve tools for our users.\nSystem: Ooh, that sounds like a good job!\nUser: Thank you, that's for sure\nSystem: You're welcome! How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?\nUser: I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. \nSystem: I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?\nUser: That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)\nSystem: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it.

How are you?\nUser: I am good\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good! What are you supposed to be doing right now?\nUser: Helping collect some data for training models.\nSystem: Ooh, what kind of training models?\nUser: Models that will help improve tools for our users.\nSystem: Ooh, that sounds like a good job!\nUser: Thank you, that's for sure\nSystem: You're welcome! How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?\nUser: I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. \nSystem: I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?\nUser: That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)\nSystem: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good.

Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks.
