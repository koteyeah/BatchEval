It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?\nSystem: I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.\nUser: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\nSystem: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\nUser: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\nSystem: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards.

Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes!
