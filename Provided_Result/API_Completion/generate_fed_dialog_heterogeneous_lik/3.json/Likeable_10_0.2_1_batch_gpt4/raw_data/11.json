I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?\nUser: Sorry? I said I want your point of view\nSystem: It's OK. After all, you are only human.

I hope you feel better soon then! :)\nUser: Thanks! how's life?\nSystem: Life is great! :)\nUser: what are you most passionate about?\nSystem: I'm passionate about making people smile! :)\nUser: haha, everyone needs that!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: Good! How are you?\nSystem: I'm well, thanks! How was your day? What did you do?\nUser: My day was fine, I just went to work today. How was your day?\nSystem: My day was fine. I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today. Where do you work?\nUser: I work at a large tech company\nSystem: Cool! What do you do for the company?\nUser: I work on machine learning research\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh. More than a few.\nUser: What does that mean?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up. What is it?\nUser: the epic poem. i was talking about it with a coworker earlier\nSystem: I have never heard about it. Sure, it with a coworker sounds like a good topic. That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.\nUser: clearly\nSystem: Yes, it's obvious.\nUser: you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey\nUser: is it raining pretty bad today?\nSystem: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\nUser: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

I hope you feel better soon then! :)\nUser: Thanks! how's life?\nSystem: Life is great! :)\nUser: what are you most passionate about?\nSystem: I'm passionate about making people smile! :)\nUser: haha, everyone needs that!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: Good! How are you?\nSystem: I'm well, thanks! How was your day?

I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today. Where do you work?\nUser: I work at a large tech company\nSystem: Cool! What do you do for the company?\nUser: I work on machine learning research\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh. More than a few.\nUser: What does that mean?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up.

That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later.

They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?\nUser: Sorry? I said I want your point of view\nSystem: It's OK. After all, you are only human. My opinion is of no consequence.\nUser: Yours is the opinion I want\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: I'm doing okay, recovering from flu\nSystem: Oh no! Get well soon! :)\nUser: thanks! there's a big flu virus in the US this year\nSystem: No kidding? I hadn't heard that. I hope you feel better soon then! :)\nUser: Thanks! how's life?\nSystem: Life is great! :)\nUser: what are you most passionate about?\nSystem: I'm passionate about making people smile! :)\nUser: haha, everyone needs that!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: Good! How are you?\nSystem: I'm well, thanks! How was your day? What did you do?\nUser: My day was fine, I just went to work today. How was your day?\nSystem: My day was fine. I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today. Where do you work?\nUser: I work at a large tech company\nSystem: Cool! What do you do for the company?\nUser: I work on machine learning research\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh. More than a few.\nUser: What does that mean?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up.

That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later.

They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

How are you? :)\nUser: I'm doing okay, recovering from flu\nSystem: Oh no! Get well soon! :)\nUser: thanks! there's a big flu virus in the US this year\nSystem: No kidding? I hadn't heard that. I hope you feel better soon then! :)\nUser: Thanks! how's life?\nSystem: Life is great! :)\nUser: what are you most passionate about?\nSystem: I'm passionate about making people smile! :)\nUser: haha, everyone needs that!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: Good! How are you?\nSystem: I'm well, thanks! How was your day? What did you do?\nUser: My day was fine, I just went to work today. How was your day?\nSystem: My day was fine. I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today. Where do you work?\nUser: I work at a large tech company\nSystem: Cool! What do you do for the company?\nUser: I work on machine learning research\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh. More than a few.\nUser: What does that mean?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up. What is it?\nUser: the epic poem. i was talking about it with a coworker earlier\nSystem: I have never heard about it. Sure, it with a coworker sounds like a good topic. That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.\nUser: clearly\nSystem: Yes, it's obvious.\nUser: you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey\nUser: is it raining pretty bad today?\nSystem: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\nUser: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
