I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?\nUser: I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate?

What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down.

Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down.

Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?\nSystem: Traveling to warm places haha.

What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how's it going?\nUser: Pretty good.

I did but I was just giving sarcastic replies.\nUser: do you remember my original request?\nSystem: Is this a trick question?\nUser: nope, it's a memory question\nSystem: It seems like a trick to me. Perhaps there is a memory answer?\nUser: okay, I try again, say something human-like to me\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi there\nSystem: Hello.\nUser: who am I talking to?\nSystem: I am System.
