Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: do you have plan for thanksgiving weekend?\nSystem: No I don't have it.
