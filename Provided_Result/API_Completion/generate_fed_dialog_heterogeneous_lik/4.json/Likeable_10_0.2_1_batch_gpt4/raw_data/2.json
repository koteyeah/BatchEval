Just having some morning tea\nUser: are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?\nSystem: I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?\nUser: I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha\nSystem: I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!\nUser: that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?\nSystem: Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: doing okay, feeling a little bit under the weather\nSystem: Aw, I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: thanks! the weather is getting worse\nSystem: Oh no, I'm sorry. I hope it gets better for you soon.\nUser: no, it won't get better any time soon. we have to wait until spring\nSystem: Aww, sorry to hear that.\nUser: yea, I'm really feeling under the weather\nSystem: Aw, well that's no good.\nUser: yea, any suggestion to get over feeling under the weather\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi.

What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did.

I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha...

I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster.\nSystem: lol... what kind of robot boy you'd like?\nUser: What's so funny? I am the robot.\nSystem: are you angry?\nUser: Anger is a difficult emotion. For me, I am always feeling happy and talkative.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!
