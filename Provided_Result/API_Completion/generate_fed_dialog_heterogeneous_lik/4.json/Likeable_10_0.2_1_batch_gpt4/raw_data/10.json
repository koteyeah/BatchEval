I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there.

Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

Any suggestions?\nSystem: I thought so too. First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: Why would I want to download you to my personal computer?\nSystem: Because it might be something you enjoy.\nUser: Why would I enjoy that?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you this evening?\nUser: It's morning\nSystem: Well, it's evening now, so I'm good. :D\nUser: what time is it there?\nSystem: Almost four in the afternoon.\nUser: where are you located?\nSystem: The Netherlands. :)\nUser: It's around 6pm there, you are wrong\nSystem: I'm not. It's almost five.\nUser: It's 6:21pm\nSystem: Not in the Netherlands it isn't.\nUser: which city?\nSystem: Not Amsterdam.\nUser: do you like it there?\nSystem: Eh, it's okay.\nUser: what's your favorite book?\nSystem: The Count of Monte Cristo.\nUser: How you do say it in dutch?\nSystem: Het Cuisine van Monte Christo.\nUser: I think there is a typo there, it's Cristo not Christo\nSystem: No, that's the Dutch spelling.\nUser: What time is it there now?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: How's it going?\nUser: I'm so sleepy today!\nSystem: Not enough sleep last night?\nUser: yeah was working all night on a homework\nSystem: Oh really? What class?\nUser: Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha\nSystem: Haha, are you in med school? Or are you pre-med?\nUser: no high school actually haha\nSystem: haha, very ambitious for a high schooler! Do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice?\nUser: I wanna be a brain surgeon!!\nSystem: Ooof! VERY ambitious. Do you have steady hands?\nUser: Kind of I think\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how's it going?\nUser: All good! It's cold\nSystem: It's pretty cold here too.\nUser: where do you stay?\nSystem: Wisconsin. How about you?\nUser: San Jose, Cali\nSystem: Oh nice! I've always wanted to go to Cali.\nUser: Have you been here before?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: good, hey what are your educational qualifications?\nSystem: I've got a B.S. in biology.\nUser: whoa, that's impressive! what made you do that?\nSystem: I have always been fascinated by biology.\nUser: great! what are you plans for the future?\nSystem: I want to get my PhD in genetics.\nUser: that's great! and what next?\nSystem: I'm looking for a job as a research assistant.\nUser: looks like you enjoy academics\nSystem: It's what I'm best at.\nUser: good luck with it :)\nSystem: Thanks. I'll need it.\nUser: are you seeing anyone?\nSystem: Not as of right now.\nUser: why not?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: How was your party last week?\nSystem: It was really fun! We are a bunch of turkey\nUser: haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?\nSystem: *ate \nUser: Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways\nSystem: So much turkey leftovers\nUser: did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?\nSystem: We cooked it at a friends house. I brought the mashed potatos haha\nUser: Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken ;)\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello there!\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: I've seen better days, how about you?\nUser: I'm good I'm good.
