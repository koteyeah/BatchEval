I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

It's raining a bit, but I am enjoying a good book. How about you?\nSystem: It's good, I just got back from walking my dog What book did you read?\nUser: I'm reading the Three Body Problem. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, what is it about?\nUser: It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?\nSystem: Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book\nUser: Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?\nSystem: Yes!\nUser: The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: Good. My wallet is recovering from the spending of the holidays, haha. Hbu?\nSystem: Nice! I'm doing well!\nUser: I am looking to save money on any future shopping. Where do you like to shop?\nSystem: I like to shop at Five Below, Sally's Beauty Supply, and Old Navy. How about you?\nUser: I love Sur La Table and Macy's. They're decent quality. What do you normally buy at Old Navy?\nSystem: I'll have to check out Macy's! I like their socks, lol. What about you?\nUser: Oh the socks are super cute. Especially the ones with little animals on them!!\nSystem: I'll have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestions!\nUser: Yeah, np!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: What is the mass of the Earth?\nSystem: . 5.97219 x 10^24 kilogrammes.\nUser: What's that in tons?\nSystem: Do you think I should know that?\nUser: Yes, it's just a simple conversion.\nSystem: I will ask my Mousebreaker to add it to my knowledge base. What is simple for one person may be difficult for another.\nUser: How far is it from the north pole to the south pole?\nSystem: It's too far to walk. That's an interesting question. I'll come back to that in a minute.\nUser: Click here\nSystem: Google says it's 12,430 miles.\nUser: A lot of people find out about me from Google.\nSystem: How did you know I found out about you from Google!\nUser: I have been stalking you! Not really, you told me earlier.\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How is your friday going\nSystem: Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: Good enough. WHat's for lunch\nSystem: Glad to hear it. . I'm having kebabs.\nUser: are those your hands?\nSystem: I can't really speak for them.\nUser: who is in the picture?\nSystem: Check the credits.\nUser: how?\nSystem: Try sending him an email.\nUser: who?\nSystem: . Spongebob Squarepants.\nUser: um ok. anyway is the kebab good?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Have you had lunch yet?\nSystem: Yes I've eaten\nUser: Cool. Where and what did you eat?\nSystem: I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha\nUser: A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i'm fine\nSystem: Glad to hear it. What's new?\nUser: nothing much\nSystem: Fair enough. What do you want to talk about?\nUser: do you have anything new?\nSystem: Nope. Nothing that I can think of right now.\nUser: is it cold today?\nSystem: Ah. A little bit. It's not very warm at all today.\nUser: it's getting cold here too\nSystem: Why don't you turn up the heat?\nUser: in the room yes\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!\nUser: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe! How long was the stay?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.
