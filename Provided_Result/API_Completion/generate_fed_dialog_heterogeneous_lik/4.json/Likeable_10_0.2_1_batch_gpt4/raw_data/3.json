How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.\nUser: i have sore throats\nSystem: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: I'm doing okay, recovering from flu\nSystem: Oh no!

I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise.

Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me!

Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"? Do I know it?\nUser: what do you do on weekends ?\nSystem: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.\nUser: what's your favorite language\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.\nUser: What's the most recent good thing you read?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!
