Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days.

Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days.
