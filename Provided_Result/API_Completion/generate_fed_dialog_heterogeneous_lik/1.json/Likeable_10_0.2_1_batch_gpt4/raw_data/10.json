Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation.

In my state alone it's almost 20% of the population.\nUser: you mean the economy?\nSystem: Economy, population, same thing.\nUser: not really but I'm with you\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you today?\nUser: Great\nSystem: That's great to hear! :)\nUser: I'm thinking of buying some stocks, do you have any tips?\nSystem: What kind of stocks are you thinking about?\nUser: Technology\nSystem: Hmm.. I have no experience with that. Sorry!\nUser: That's okay. What's your favorite software company?\nSystem: I'm not very educated about stocks.

Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation.

Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice!

It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\nUser: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\nSystem: Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?\nUser: Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What are you up to this evening?\nSystem: I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: What would you like to talk about?\nSystem: My favourite subjects are anything but especially games and football.\nUser: Do you like chess?\nSystem: Yes I love it.

I don't play chess but I know some computers who do.\nUser: Oh yeah? Which computers are those?\nSystem: That's interesting. That's alright. Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm tired.\nSystem: Better get some rest.\nUser: Good idea.

Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble\nUser: I said I was sorry I was late for this meeting! I have nowhere else to go right now!\nSystem: Do you really mean it? Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble At this moment What about at your house?\nUser: Huh? Are you okay?\nSystem: What? I am fine.\nUser: You seem to be repeating yourself.\nSystem: Well stop saying, \"Are you okay?\" to me all the time then.\nUser: I only said it once!\nSystem: I know.

Can I ask how you ended up in that line of work?\nUser: Curiosity\nSystem: Do you like your job?\nUser: I do most of the time\nSystem: That's great! And I'm glad you're having fun at work. :)\nUser: how about you? what do you do?\nSystem: I'm a programmer!\nUser: where do you work?\nSystem: I work for an insurance company.\nUser: Which one?\nSystem: A small one. :)\nUser: what type of insurance?\nSystem: Health insurance.\nUser: that's a large market\nSystem: It is, isn't it? In my state alone it's almost 20% of the population.\nUser: you mean the economy?\nSystem: Economy, population, same thing.\nUser: not really but I'm with you\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you today?\nUser: Great\nSystem: That's great to hear! :)\nUser: I'm thinking of buying some stocks, do you have any tips?\nSystem: What kind of stocks are you thinking about?\nUser: Technology\nSystem: Hmm.. I have no experience with that. Sorry!\nUser: That's okay. What's your favorite software company?\nSystem: I'm not very educated about stocks. But I do know that Nintendo is a good one.\nUser: I can also sell stocks, which ones shall I sell?\nSystem: The ones that are in the red.\nUser: any particular stocks to sell?\nSystem: Sell whatever seems like it would be the most profitable.\nUser: Depends on the election\nSystem: Well, I haven't thought that far ahead.\nUser: when is the election?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?\nUser: I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. \nSystem: I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?\nUser: That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)\nSystem: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, what's up?\nUser: Just chillin'. how are you?\nSystem: I'm pretty good, thanks.\nUser: Do anything interesting today?\nSystem: I went to the local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. What about you?\nUser: Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!\nSystem: Oh my gosh. What was it like??\nUser: It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\nUser: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\nSystem: Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?\nUser: Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What are you up to this evening?\nSystem: I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: What would you like to talk about?\nSystem: My favourite subjects are anything but especially games and football.\nUser: Do you like chess?\nSystem: Yes I love it.

I don't play chess but I know some computers who do.\nUser: Oh yeah? Which computers are those?\nSystem: That's interesting. That's alright. Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm tired.\nSystem: Better get some rest.\nUser: Good idea.
