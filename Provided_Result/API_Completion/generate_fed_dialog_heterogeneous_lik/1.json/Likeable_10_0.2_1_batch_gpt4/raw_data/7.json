You're going to have a great time.\nUser: thx! do you have any recommendation?\nSystem: Italy: Rome, Venice, Florence Spain: Barcelona, Madrid, Tenerife, Malaga France: Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges Belgium: Antwerp, Bruges Austria: Vienna, Salzburg\nUser: wow, what a lot\nSystem: The Netherlands: Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen, Lagos, Brussels.\nUser: which is the best for you?\nSystem: I've only been to Rome and Paris.\nUser: cool do you like them?\nSystem: Rome was pretty nice, Paris was okay.\nUser: gotcha I will go to Paris\nSystem: It's a cool city.\nUser: agree I really look forward to visiting the city\nSystem: Did you see the Eiffel Tower?\nUser: not yet, have you?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :D\nUser: i am good\nSystem: Well, that's good to hear. :D\nUser: can you tell me the weather today\nSystem: It's raining. You? :D\nUser: oh! where are you\nSystem: I'm in Texas. :D You?\nUser: cool, i am in the bay area\nSystem: Cool. Do you like it there?\nUser: yes\nSystem: Well, I'm glad you like it. :D\nUser: have you been here\nSystem: I haven't. :D\nUser: ok bye then\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: Everything is going extremely well.

So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo?

Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.
