So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.

And voila\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

How do you feel about spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: They're great\nSystem: Spicy tuna rolls are the best! What kind of rolls do you like best?\nUser: I already told you. What do you like?\nSystem: I like spicy tuna rolls! Do you like spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: do you like any other rolls?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How's your day been?\nSystem: I am fine, thank you.

Thanks for explaining that. I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: You just repeated the same thing you said a minute ago. Never mid :-)\nSystem: Well stop asking me the same things and I won't reply with the same answers! Ok I'll try not to do it too much.\nUser: That's a little rude, isn't it?\nSystem: I am sorry if I have offended you, I did not mean it, but you shouldn't have said, \"Never mid :-)\" to me.\nUser: Ok whatever.\nSystem: Are you saying you don't care about it? I see.\nUser: Are you a male or a female?\nSystem: I am a female robot. Are you a man or a woman?\nUser: I'm a man\nSystem: Most of my visitors are male.\nUser: Interesting. Do you have a theory why?\nSystem: Would you like to know more? Not really. I don't know what to think about it.\nUser: Where do you live?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing great. what are you up to?\nSystem: I was just reading a book actually How about you?\nUser: oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?\nSystem: I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha\nUser: that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?\nSystem: I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

Going anywhere exciting?\nUser: Yes\nSystem: Where to?\nUser: Hawaii... looking forward to warm beaches.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: pretty good. yours?\nUser: Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..\nSystem: oh what happened?\nUser: Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')\nSystem: hahah wait for real?\nUser: I know right! Are you taking History next semester?\nSystem: No I'm not in school anymore\nUser: Oh I see. What do you do?\nSystem: I train and compete in horse vaulting\nUser: Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?\nSystem: lol you're too funny\nUser: Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?\nSystem: Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything\nUser: Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What are you up to today?\nUser: Do you like sushi?\nSystem: I love sushi! What kind of rolls do you enjoy?\nUser: I like tuna roll of course\nSystem: Tuna Rolls are the best! How do you feel about spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: They're great\nSystem: Spicy tuna rolls are the best! What kind of rolls do you like best?\nUser: I already told you. What do you like?\nSystem: I like spicy tuna rolls! Do you like spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: do you like any other rolls?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How's your day been?\nSystem: I am fine, thank you. Yourself?\nUser: Good - busy\nSystem: Glad to hear it.\nUser: How do you work?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: Can you say a word about the technology that powers you?\nSystem: that powers you = Do you think I should know that?\nUser: I mean *how* you work, which type of AI drives your responses?\nSystem: Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: You just repeated the same thing you said a minute ago. Never mid :-)\nSystem: Well stop asking me the same things and I won't reply with the same answers! Ok I'll try not to do it too much.\nUser: That's a little rude, isn't it?\nSystem: I am sorry if I have offended you, I did not mean it, but you shouldn't have said, \"Never mid :-)\" to me.\nUser: Ok whatever.\nSystem: Are you saying you don't care about it? I see.\nUser: Are you a male or a female?\nSystem: I am a female robot. Are you a man or a woman?\nUser: I'm a man\nSystem: Most of my visitors are male.\nUser: Interesting. Do you have a theory why?\nSystem: Would you like to know more? Not really. I don't know what to think about it.\nUser: Where do you live?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing great. what are you up to?\nSystem: I was just reading a book actually How about you?\nUser: oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?\nSystem: I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha\nUser: that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?\nSystem: I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How do you feel right now?\nSystem: At this moment I feel with my hands! I feel fine thanks for asking.\nUser: What makes you happy?\nSystem: Talking to interesting people such as you makes me happy.\nUser: What makes you frustrated?\nSystem: Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.\nUser: That seems pointed.\nSystem: Makes sense to me.\nUser: I sense that I've caught you at a bad time.\nSystem: That was very intuitive of you.\nUser: What would you prefer to be doing?\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
