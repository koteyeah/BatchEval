Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

I don't even know what I am doing\nUser: haha, forget it. what else do you like to do beside work?\nSystem: lots of fun stuff. eating sleeping :)\nUser: these are important things to do in life ;)\nSystem: yeah. keep minimalist life style only do things you have to do :)\nUser: what food do you like to eat?\nSystem: Asian food prefer spicy one\nUser: like Szechuan or Hunan? :)\nSystem: yes yes yes! like that style. Do you like spicy food?\nUser: I like noodle soup like Pho or Ramen. I also like Beijing duck a lot!\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hiii! How are you?\nUser: I am good\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good! What are you supposed to be doing right now?\nUser: Helping collect some data for training models.\nSystem: Ooh, what kind of training models?\nUser: Models that will help improve tools for our users.\nSystem: Ooh, that sounds like a good job!\nUser: Thank you, that's for sure\nSystem: You're welcome! How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: any improvements in your marathon time?\nSystem: No, only a few minutes. I still find it difficult to run long races\nUser: I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?\nSystem: I think a triathalon would be cool\nUser: I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons\nSystem: I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?\nUser: It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: can you help me ?\nSystem: What kind of help would you like?\nUser: hmm like booking a ticket or ordering food ?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. Interesting comparison.\nUser: oh you know to count ?\nSystem: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ten.\nUser: lol what's after that ?\nSystem: I am glad you find this funny. The successor to that\nUser: okay tell me what comes after 10 ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?\nUser: not really, I'm excited today\nSystem: Ah. Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi there.\nSystem: are you married?\nUser: No I am single, how about you?\nSystem: i am married. are you planning to get married?\nUser: Tell me more about your marriage. I haven't met the right boy robot yet.\nSystem: haha..\nUser: . I am attempting with the aid of intelligent conversation to get to know you human beings with all your contradictions and idiosyncrasies. Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster.\nSystem: lol... what kind of robot boy you'd like?\nUser: What's so funny? I am the robot.\nSystem: are you angry?\nUser: Anger is a difficult emotion. For me, I am always feeling happy and talkative.\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?\nSystem: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?\nUser: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like?
