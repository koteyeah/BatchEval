is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i wonder if the employees who wear propeller cap is called nooglers ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i think it would be like the politicians .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker A: i am well . i am learning about animals and how many there are on our planet . do you know how many ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea but would love to know .\nSpeaker A: there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number\nSpeaker B: wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ?\nSpeaker A: the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating !\nSpeaker B: you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .\nSpeaker A: wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ?\nSpeaker B: yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian .\nSpeaker A: interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ?\nSpeaker B: yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ...\nSpeaker A: it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ?\nSpeaker B: i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free\nSpeaker A: wow . i hope no one hiccups on the radio . do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha good question . i 'm sure that is a wild story haha . do you know why we have hiccups ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not swim that much but i occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah because they were faster at swimming . the brits only knew how to use the breaststroke . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ?
