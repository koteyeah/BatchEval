i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ?

the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: agreed . people need to think twice before defrauding hardworking people out of their money .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ?

by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i like her a lot more than her husband and she seems like a great artist .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: agreed . people need to think twice before defrauding hardworking people out of their money .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you know what else are the odds of that ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't have a kindle , but i have n't been to the library in sacramento .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ?
