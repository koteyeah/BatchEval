i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do . did you know there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free ?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he is a great coach , i do nt know why he won . i know that he was the browns last playoff win was in 1995 .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , it 's really impressive , and the nba only produced one in canada .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you today ? staying warm ?\nSpeaker A: trying just watching some netflix .. kyle kinane is hilarious .. one of my favorite comedies .\nSpeaker B: he is funny i know ! lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he has a special on netflix and kind of drives into political issue . he also does stand up in a washington dc club . \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is very interesting , i do n't know how they could read that fast either .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have not . i have not . what is it about ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha ya i do n't know , i do n't know why they do n't have flamethrowers on the back of the car though , i do n't know why they would have wooden trunks on the back\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\nSpeaker A: i do nt even know what else they air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ; amazing !\nSpeaker A: i know right , seems crazy to have him in almost every one then to forget him completely in that one\nSpeaker B: do you still watch things on traditional tv ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i love the simpsons !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i wonder what the president of zimbabwe looks like ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
