i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it must be a really strong cable for sure , so do you like cars ? you know the first car to be mass produced was a ford . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wish the us would move away from the two party system . all the us presidents since 1853 have either been republican or democrat . if we had other parties , maybe the country would be less divided .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do too , i also really enjoy series , it has been a really successful cast though\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not swim that much but i occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you know how the british only got breaststroke before ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ?

really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i wonder if the world record holder for speed reading comprehension\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if google is still around . i wonder if the employees who wear a propeller hat to new employees are called nooglers .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think she has a lot of influence and she has a great voice . she also walks backwards to avoid having her photo taken .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\nSpeaker A: i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?\nSpeaker B: yes it is pink but i a not sure why they chose that color\nSpeaker A: i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them\nSpeaker B: i wonder too . bowling was more popular than football in the 60s\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers made more than football players\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it must be a really strong cable for sure , so do you like cars ? you know the first car to be mass produced was a ford . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wish the us would move away from the two party system . all the us presidents since 1853 have either been republican or democrat . if we had other parties , maybe the country would be less divided .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do too , i also really enjoy series , it has been a really successful cast though\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not swim that much but i occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you know how the british only got breaststroke before ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
