( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i 'm a fan of the nfl .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of football ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a huge football fan . how about yourself ?\nSpeaker A: i love football both college and nfl , do you have a favorite nfl team of the 32 ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a new england patriots fan and huge fan of tom brady how about you ?\nSpeaker A: nice i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's unbeliavable . maybe football was n't as exciting back then . i heard the most one-sided game ever was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 - 0 . those cumberland players should try their hand at bowling .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i bet they did . i think creed should have a concert that was so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit against them .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is pretty cool . i wonder if he ever ordered something from the clock that jeff bezos had built into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't really watch it , but i do n't really like it , i like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , how are you doing ? do you like xxxtentacion ?\nSpeaker A: i never heard of him . i understand that he had been fatally shot . how sad .\nSpeaker B: that is sad . i ve heard of him too , but never listened to the music .\nSpeaker A: apparently he had a number 1 hit posthumously\nSpeaker B: right and then more of his songs entered the top 100 . these eight are \" moonlight \" at no . 16 , \" changes \" at no . 18 , \" jocelyn flores \" at no . 19 , one with an unprintable title at no . 28 , \" everybody dies on their nightmares \" at no . 42 , \" the remedy for a broke heart ( why am i so in love ) \" at no . 58 , \" hope \" at no . 80 , and \" numb \" at no . 82 .\nSpeaker A: wow . that 's incredible . the lines of his song were sad talking about suicide\nSpeaker B: seems like a lot of musicians and actor / actress ' suffer from some kind of ailment . its so sad .\nSpeaker A: they 've got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work . rapper tupac shakur 's music is in the library of congress of \" cultural significance . \"\nSpeaker A: it takes death for things to happen and people realize the talent . when prince died his sales went up\nSpeaker B: absolutely kinda like a last tribute to them . before he became a rapper , eminem 's true dream was to become a comic\nSpeaker A: funny . did you know mcdonalds payed rappers $ 5 for everytime they referenced big macs in songs\nSpeaker B: what ! that s amazing . haha rapper busta rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the 1998 rugrats movie\nSpeaker A: that 's cool ! did you also know that there is a deaf rapper who rhymes in sign language . that is awesome\nSpeaker B: some rappers have a sign language translator on stage with them . i 've seen it on youtube !\nSpeaker A: that 's great ! the world 's fastest rapper noclue raps 14.1 syllables per second\nSpeaker B: korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle , it 's called \" compliment battle \" .\nSpeaker A: really , do they do compliments ?\nSpeaker B: i do nt know , but i am visiting korea in a few , so maybe i will find out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that sounds awesome . i always enjoy listening to music from other cultures , it 's sometimes a strange experience . there 's a radio station that lets you listen to the sun 's music , what an interesting concept !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each

have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that

got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work .

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i 'm a fan of the nfl .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of football ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a huge football fan . how about yourself ?\nSpeaker A: i love football both college and nfl , do you have a favorite nfl team of the 32 ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a new england patriots fan and huge fan of tom brady how about you ?\nSpeaker A: nice i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's unbeliavable . maybe football was n't as exciting back then . i heard the most one-sided game ever was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 - 0 . those cumberland players should try their hand at bowling .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i bet they did . i think creed should have a concert that was so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit against them .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is pretty cool . i wonder if he ever ordered something from the clock that jeff bezos had built into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't really watch it , but i do n't really like it , i like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should

B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is pretty cool . i wonder if he ever ordered something from the clock that jeff bezos had built into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't really watch it , but i do n't really like it , i like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , how are you doing ? do you like xxxtentacion ?\nSpeaker A: i never heard of him . i understand that he had been fatally shot . how sad .\nSpeaker B: that is sad . i ve heard of him too , but never listened to the music .\nSpeaker A: apparently he had a number 1 hit posthumously\nSpeaker B: right and then more of his songs entered the top 100 . these eight are \" moonlight \" at no . 16 , \" changes \" at no . 18 , \" jocelyn flores \" at no . 19 , one with an unprintable title at no . 28 , \" everybody dies on their nightmares \" at no . 42 , \" the remedy for a broke heart ( why am i so in love ) \" at no . 58 , \" hope \" at no . 80 , and \" numb \" at no . 82 .\nSpeaker A: wow . that 's incredible . the lines of his song were sad talking about suicide\nSpeaker B: seems like a lot of musicians and actor / actress ' suffer from some kind of ailment . its so sad .\nSpeaker A: they 've got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work . rapper tupac shakur 's music is in the library of congress of \" cultural significance . \"\nSpeaker A: it takes death for things to happen and people realize the talent . when prince died his sales went up\nSpeaker B: absolutely kinda like a last tribute to them . before he became a rapper , eminem 's true dream was to become a comic\nSpeaker A: funny . did you know mcdonalds payed rappers $ 5 for everytime they referenced big macs in songs\nSpeaker B: what ! that s amazing . haha rapper busta rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the 1998 rugrats movie\nSpeaker A: that 's cool ! did you also know that there is a deaf rapper who rhymes in sign language . that is awesome\nSpeaker B: some rappers have a sign language translator on stage with them . i 've seen it on youtube !\nSpeaker A: that 's great ! the world 's fastest rapper noclue raps 14.1 syllables per second\nSpeaker B: korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle , it 's called \" compliment battle \" .\nSpeaker A: really , do they do compliments ?\nSpeaker B: i do nt know , but i am visiting korea in a few , so maybe i will find out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that sounds awesome . i always enjoy listening to music from other cultures , it 's sometimes a strange experience . there 's a radio station that lets you listen to the sun 's music , what an interesting concept !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if

i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's unbeliavable . maybe football was n't as exciting back then . i heard the most one-sided game ever was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 - 0 . those cumberland players should try their hand at bowling .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B:

that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i bet they did . i think creed should have a concert that was so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit against them .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i 'm a fan of the nfl .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of football ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a huge football fan . how about yourself ?\nSpeaker A: i love football both college and nfl , do you have a favorite nfl team of the 32 ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a new england patriots fan and huge fan of tom brady how about you ?\nSpeaker A: nice i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's unbeliavable . maybe football was n't as exciting back then . i heard the most one-sided game ever was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 - 0 . those cumberland players should try their hand at bowling .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i bet they did . i think creed should have a concert that was so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit against them .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is pretty cool . i wonder if he ever ordered something from the clock that jeff bezos had built into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't really watch it , but i do n't really like it , i like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , how are you doing ? do you like xxxtentacion ?\nSpeaker A: i never heard of him . i understand that he had been fatally shot . how sad .\nSpeaker B: that is sad . i ve heard of him too , but never listened to the music .\nSpeaker A: apparently he had a number 1 hit posthumously\nSpeaker B: right and then more of his songs entered the top 100 . these eight are \" moonlight \" at no . 16 , \" changes \" at no . 18 , \" jocelyn flores \" at no . 19 , one with an unprintable title at no . 28 , \" everybody dies on their nightmares \" at no . 42 , \" the remedy for a broke heart ( why am i so in love ) \" at no . 58 , \" hope \" at no . 80 , and \" numb \" at no . 82 .\nSpeaker A: wow . that 's incredible . the lines of his song were sad talking about suicide\nSpeaker B: seems like a lot of musicians and actor / actress ' suffer from some kind of ailment . its so sad .\nSpeaker A: they 've got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work . rapper tupac shakur 's music is in the library of congress of \" cultural significance . \"\nSpeaker A: it takes death for things to happen and people realize the talent . when prince died his sales went up\nSpeaker B: absolutely kinda like a last tribute to them . before he became a rapper , eminem 's true dream was to become a comic\nSpeaker A: funny . did you know mcdonalds payed rappers $ 5 for everytime they referenced big macs in songs\nSpeaker B: what ! that s amazing . haha rapper busta rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the 1998 rugrats movie\nSpeaker A: that 's cool ! did you also know that there is a deaf rapper who rhymes in sign language . that is awesome\nSpeaker B: some rappers have a sign language translator on stage with them . i 've seen it on youtube !\nSpeaker A: that 's great ! the world 's fastest rapper noclue raps 14.1 syllables per second\nSpeaker B: korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle , it 's called \" compliment battle \" .\nSpeaker A: really , do they do compliments ?\nSpeaker B: i do nt know , but i am visiting korea in a few , so maybe i will find out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that sounds awesome . i always enjoy listening to music from other cultures , it 's sometimes a strange experience . there 's a radio station that lets you listen to the sun 's music , what an interesting concept !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i 'm a fan of the nfl .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of football ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a huge football fan . how about yourself

i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's unbeliavable . maybe football was n't as exciting back then . i heard the most one-sided game ever was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 - 0 . those cumberland players should try their hand at bowling .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i bet they did . i think creed should have a concert that was so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit against them .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is pretty cool . i wonder if he ever ordered something from the clock that jeff bezos had built into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't really watch it , but i do n't really like it , i like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , how are you doing ? do you like xxxtentacion ?\nSpeaker A: i never heard of him . i understand that he had

cool . i wonder if he ever ordered something from the clock that jeff bezos had built into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't really watch it , but i do n't really like it , i like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , how are you doing ? do you like xxxtentacion ?\nSpeaker A: i never heard of him . i understand that he had been fatally shot . how sad .\nSpeaker B: that is sad . i ve heard of him too , but never listened to the music .\nSpeaker A: apparently he had a number 1 hit posthumously\nSpeaker B: right and then more of his songs entered the top 100 . these eight are \" moonlight \" at no . 16 , \" changes \" at no . 18 , \" jocelyn flores \" at no . 19 , one with an unprintable title at no . 28 , \" everybody dies on their nightmares \" at no . 42 , \" the remedy for a broke heart ( why am i so in love ) \" at no . 58 , \" hope \" at no . 80 , and \" numb \" at no . 82 .\nSpeaker A: wow . that 's incredible . the lines of his song were sad talking about suicide\nSpeaker B: seems like a lot of musicians and actor / actress ' suffer from some kind of ailment . its so sad .\nSpeaker A: they 've got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work . rapper tupac shakur 's music is in the library of congress of \" cultural significance . \"\nSpeaker A: it takes death for things to happen and people realize the talent . when prince died his sales went up\nSpeaker B: absolutely kinda like a last tribute to them . before he became a rapper , eminem 's true dream was to become a comic\nSpeaker A: funny . did you know mcdonalds payed rappers $ 5 for everytime they referenced big macs in songs\nSpeaker B: what ! that s amazing . haha rapper busta rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the 1998 rugrats movie\nSpeaker A: that 's cool ! did you also know that there is a deaf rapper who rhymes in sign language . that is awesome\nSpeaker B: some rappers have a sign language translator on stage with them . i 've seen it on youtube !\nSpeaker A: that 's great ! the world 's fastest rapper noclue raps 14.1 syllables per second\nSpeaker B: korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle , it 's called \" compliment battle \" .\nSpeaker A: really , do they do compliments ?\nSpeaker B: i do nt know , but i am visiting korea in a few , so maybe i will find out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that sounds awesome . i always enjoy listening to music from other cultures , it 's sometimes a strange experience . there 's a radio station that lets you listen to the sun 's music , what an interesting concept !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i 'm a fan of the nfl .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of football ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a huge football fan . how about yourself ?\nSpeaker A: i love football both college and nfl , do you have a favorite nfl team of the 32 ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a new england patriots fan and huge fan of tom brady how about you ?\nSpeaker A: nice i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's unbeliavable . maybe football was n't as exciting back then . i heard the most one-sided game ever was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 - 0 . those cumberland players should try their hand at bowling .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i bet they did . i think creed should have a concert that was so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit against them .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is pretty cool . i wonder if he ever ordered something from the clock that jeff bezos had built into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't really watch it , but i do n't really like it , i like it , what about you ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now
