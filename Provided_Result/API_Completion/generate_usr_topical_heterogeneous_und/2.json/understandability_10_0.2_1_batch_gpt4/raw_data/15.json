true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he is a great coach , i do nt know why he won . i know that he was the browns last playoff win was in 1995 .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

they do wear the uniform after all .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is crazy , maybe if the guy who worked for his grandpa was a lawyer they could have and all worked on the d.c election .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: apparently baseball managers are technically allowed to play for their teams ! \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey , ever use facebook ?\nSpeaker B: i do , it is the primary source of news for 30 % of american adults . do you use facebook your self ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: constantly , unfortunately . i 'd consider burger king 's offer to get a free whopper by unfriending 10 people if i liked burger king . \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he is a great coach , i do nt know why he won . i know that he was the browns last playoff win was in 1995 .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he is a great coach , i do nt know why he won . i know that he was the browns last playoff win was in 1995 .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
