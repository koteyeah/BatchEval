i do n't really care as long as i can listen to him on the radio ! i love two things on my radio : indonesian pop music and electromagnetic storms from jupiter . those are my go to listening pleasures !\nSpeaker B: yeah that is so cool that if you turn your radio to am , you may capture jupiter 's storms\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes ! that 's so cool ! speaking of radio , i do n't think i 'd ever heard a radio to listen to those storms on jupiter on the radio , apparently they are required to have at least 40 % % of the music played be canadian !\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,\nSpeaker A: what do you mean by sensible loss ?
