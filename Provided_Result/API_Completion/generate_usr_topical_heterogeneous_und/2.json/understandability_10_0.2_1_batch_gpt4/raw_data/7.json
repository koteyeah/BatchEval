by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess she walks backwards so maybe that she should not be free .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: morning ! are you a comedy fan ?\nSpeaker A: morning ! yes , some of it . have you watched anything good recently ?\nSpeaker B: kung fu hustle . ever seen it ?
