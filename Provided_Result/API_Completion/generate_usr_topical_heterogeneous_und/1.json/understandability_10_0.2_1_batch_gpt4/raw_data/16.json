run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he was an all star and did the money . i think it 's interesting . i wonder how many albums he had .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea . there has n't been a president who was n't a republican or democrat since 1853 .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i wonder if they were still around when they were playing ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think he was a great player , he was a great player , his sister had a sister who was always better than him\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , he was the perfect director for the movie . i guess he was in the movie as a kid\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i wonder if they were still around when they were playing ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ?

pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i wonder if they were still around when they were playing ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ?

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i wonder if they were still around when they were playing ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ?

i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he was an all star and did the money . i think it 's interesting . i wonder how many albums he had .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea . there has n't been a president who was n't a republican or democrat since 1853 .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i wonder if they were still around when they were playing ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think he was a great player , he was a great player , his sister had a sister who was always better than him\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , he was the perfect director for the movie . i guess he was in the movie as a kid\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
