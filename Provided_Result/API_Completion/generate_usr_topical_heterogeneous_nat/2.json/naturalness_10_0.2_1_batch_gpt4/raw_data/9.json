month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so true . nice chatting with you !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you would think so . i would n't be surprised if i were n't as good as the 24 hour hour day and the only represent a little over a minute .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it was written by brad bird ! he also was the directer and provided the voice for edna mode in the movie . \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \"

we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if they have a different name like the president of indonesia 's book .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i wonder if they have tested on the backs in the 1800s\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . did you know the president of indonesia is a pop star ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard of doug harey ?\nSpeaker A: was n't he an umpire for the mlb ?\nSpeaker B: yes he just died at 87 years of age .\nSpeaker A: i guess he was a big deal , and he lived quite a while . he 'll be missed though\nSpeaker B: he must 've been an interesting character to earn the nick name ' god ' .\nSpeaker A: he was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing\nSpeaker B: yup , he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games .\nSpeaker A: and five world series , which is a big leagues in the mlb . he was n't intimidated by anyone , it seems\nSpeaker B: he was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903 .\nSpeaker A: that 's incredible ! do you pay attention to baseball much ?\nSpeaker B: no i did when i was younger but lost interest . how bout you ?\nSpeaker A: every once in a while . it 's one of those sports i would rather play than watch . the japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name \" national pastime \" from the americans if they could\nSpeaker B: yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too .\nSpeaker A: enough that people used to collect baseball cards . one man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million dollars\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of money . are any managers cards worth anything ? they do wear the uniform after all .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is crazy , maybe if the guy who worked for his

?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ? i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i

country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know . i love country music . i think i 've heard that u2 once opened for themselves in 1987 . they were actually opened for themselves and then became the dalton brothers from galveston tx .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century !

month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so true . nice chatting with you !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you would think so . i would n't be surprised if i were n't as good as the 24 hour hour day and the only represent a little over a minute .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it was written by brad bird ! he also was the directer and provided the voice for edna mode in the movie . \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \"

we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if they have a different name like the president of indonesia 's book .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i wonder if they have tested on the backs in the 1800s\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . did you know the president of indonesia is a pop star ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard of doug harey ?\nSpeaker A: was n't he an umpire for the mlb ?\nSpeaker B: yes he just died at 87 years of age .\nSpeaker A: i guess he was a big deal , and he lived quite a while . he 'll be missed though\nSpeaker B: he must 've been an interesting character to earn the nick name ' god ' .\nSpeaker A: he was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing\nSpeaker B: yup , he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games .\nSpeaker A: and five world series , which is a big leagues in the mlb . he was n't intimidated by anyone , it seems\nSpeaker B: he was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903 .\nSpeaker A: that 's incredible ! do you pay attention to baseball much ?\nSpeaker B: no i did when i was younger but lost interest . how bout you ?\nSpeaker A: every once in a while . it 's one of those sports i would rather play than watch . the japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name \" national pastime \" from the americans if they could\nSpeaker B: yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too .\nSpeaker A: enough that people used to collect baseball cards . one man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million dollars\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of money . are any managers cards worth anything ? they do wear the uniform after all .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is crazy , maybe if the guy who worked for his grandpa was a lawyer they could have and all worked on the d.c election .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you would think so . i would n't be surprised if i were n't as good as the 24 hour hour day and the only represent a little over a minute .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it was written by brad bird ! he also was the directer and provided the voice for edna mode in the movie . \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A:

we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if they have a different name like the president of indonesia 's book .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i wonder if they have tested on the backs in the

' .\nSpeaker A: he was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing\nSpeaker B: yup , he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games .\nSpeaker A: and five world series , which is a big leagues in the mlb . he was n't intimidated by anyone , it seems\nSpeaker B: he was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903 .\nSpeaker A: that 's incredible ! do you pay attention to baseball much ?\nSpeaker B: no i did when i was younger but lost interest . how bout you ?\nSpeaker A: every once in a while . it 's one of those sports i would rather play than watch . the japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name \" national pastime \" from the americans if they could\nSpeaker B: yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too .\nSpeaker A: enough that people used to collect baseball cards . one man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million

?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century !

month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so true . nice chatting with you !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you would think so . i would n't be surprised if i were n't as good as the 24 hour hour day and the only represent a little over a minute .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it was written by brad bird ! he also was the directer and provided the voice for edna mode in the movie . \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \"

we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if they have a different name like the president of indonesia 's book .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i wonder if they have tested on the backs in the 1800s\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . did you know the president of indonesia is a pop star ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard of doug harey ?\nSpeaker A: was n't he an umpire for the mlb ?\nSpeaker B: yes he just died at 87 years of age .\nSpeaker A: i guess he was a big deal , and he lived quite a while . he 'll be missed though\nSpeaker B: he must 've been an interesting character to earn the nick name ' god ' .\nSpeaker A: he was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing\nSpeaker B: yup , he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games .\nSpeaker A: and five world series , which is a big leagues in the mlb . he was n't intimidated by anyone , it seems\nSpeaker B: he was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903 .\nSpeaker A: that 's incredible ! do you pay attention to baseball much ?\nSpeaker B: no i did when i was younger but lost interest . how bout you ?\nSpeaker A: every once in a while . it 's one of those sports i would rather play than watch . the japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name \" national pastime \" from the americans if they could\nSpeaker B: yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too .\nSpeaker A: enough that people used to collect baseball cards . one man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million dollars\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of money . are any managers cards worth anything ? they do wear the uniform after all .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is crazy , maybe if the guy who worked for his grandpa was a lawyer they could have and all worked on the d.c election .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so true . nice chatting with you !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you would think so . i would n't be surprised if i were n't as

love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it was written by brad bird ! he also was the directer and provided the voice for edna mode in the movie . \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \"

we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if they have a different name like the president of indonesia 's book .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i wonder if they have tested on the backs in the

' .\nSpeaker A: he was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing\nSpeaker B: yup , he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games .\nSpeaker A: and five world series , which is a big leagues in the mlb . he was n't intimidated by anyone , it seems\nSpeaker B: he was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903 .\nSpeaker A: that 's incredible ! do you pay attention to baseball much ?\nSpeaker B: no i did when i was younger but lost interest . how bout you ?\nSpeaker A: every once in a while . it 's one of those sports i would rather play than watch . the japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name \" national pastime \" from the americans if they could\nSpeaker B: yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too .\nSpeaker A: enough that people used to collect baseball cards . one man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million dollars\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of money . are any managers cards worth anything ? they do wear the uniform after all .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is crazy , maybe if the guy who worked for his
