i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so true . nice chatting with you !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know . i would like to know what the new employees are called .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do like football , i think it is a calming color and calming calming the other teams\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: imagine having hillary clinton as trump 's vp ! they could take a page out of the indonesian president 's book and release a pop album while in office .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i watch a few games here and there . did you know some teams do n't allow cheerleaders to eat in the same restauraunts as nfl players ? they actually have to leave if any nfl players walk in . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the nfl . i like the nfl .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that town in alaska is a cat mayor . in alaska\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to see that one ! i would love to see it !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you today ?
