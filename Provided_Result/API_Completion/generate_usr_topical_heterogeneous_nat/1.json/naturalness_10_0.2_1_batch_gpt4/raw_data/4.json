i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: trump is a republican . did you know there has nt been a president who was nt a republican or democrat since 1853 \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , he was a great coach ! well i m guessing he did a lot more than pro football players , i think there s a lot of talent in it all\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ? it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you like creed ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree , reading is an escape for me . unless it 's really bad writing . cs lewis and tolkien held a \" you laugh you lose \" competition where people read terrible poetry and tried not to laugh .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , he was a great coach ! well i m guessing he did a lot more than pro football players , i think there s a lot of talent in it all\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ? it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you like creed ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree , reading is an escape for me . unless it 's really bad writing . cs lewis and tolkien held a \" you laugh you lose \" competition where people read terrible poetry and tried not to laugh .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ?

really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree , reading is an escape for me . unless it 's really bad writing . cs lewis and tolkien held a \" you laugh you lose \" competition where people read terrible poetry and tried not to laugh .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: trump is a republican . did you know there has nt been a president who was nt a republican or democrat since 1853 \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , he was a great coach ! well i m guessing he did a lot more than pro football players , i think there s a lot of talent in it all\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ? it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you like creed ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ?

i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: trump is a republican . did you know there has nt been a president who was nt a republican or democrat since 1853 \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , he was a great coach ! well i m guessing he did a lot more than pro football players , i think there s a lot of talent in it all\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ? it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you like creed ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree , reading is an escape for me . unless it 's really bad writing . cs lewis and tolkien held a \" you laugh you lose \" competition where people read terrible poetry and tried not to laugh .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ?

it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you like creed ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree , reading is an escape for me . unless it 's really bad writing . cs lewis and tolkien held a \" you laugh you lose \" competition where people read terrible poetry and tried not to laugh .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: trump is a republican . did you know there has nt been a president who was nt a republican or democrat since 1853 \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , he was a great coach ! well i m guessing he did a lot more than pro football players , i think there s a lot of talent in it all\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ?

i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: trump is a republican . did you know there has nt been a president who was nt a republican or democrat since 1853 \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , he was a great coach ! well i m guessing he did a lot more than pro football players , i think there s a lot of talent in it all\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ? it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you like creed ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree , reading is an escape for me . unless it 's really bad writing . cs lewis and tolkien held a \" you laugh you lose \" competition where people read terrible poetry and tried not to laugh .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: trump is a republican . did you know there has nt been a president who was nt a republican or democrat since 1853 \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ?

it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you like creed ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree , reading is an escape for me . unless it 's really bad writing . cs lewis and tolkien held a \" you laugh you lose \" competition where people read terrible poetry and tried not to laugh .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: trump is a republican . did you know there has nt been a president who was nt a republican or democrat since 1853 \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , he was a great coach ! well i m guessing he did a lot more than pro football players , i think there s a lot of talent in it all\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ?
