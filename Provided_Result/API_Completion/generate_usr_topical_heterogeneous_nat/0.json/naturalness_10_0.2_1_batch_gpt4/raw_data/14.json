i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a great idea . i think it is a great way to keep track of things .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
