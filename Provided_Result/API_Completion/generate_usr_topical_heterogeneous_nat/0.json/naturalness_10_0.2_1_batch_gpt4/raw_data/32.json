The speaker says they don't really use Facebook, but then says they don't use it much anymore, implying they used to use it more frequently. This contradiction makes the response seem unnatural.\n\nSample2: The response seems out of context and doesn't follow the conversation about books, reading, and the military's reading list. The speaker suddenly talks about owning a car and its dangers, which is unrelated to the conversation history.\n\nSample3: The response is related to the conversation about football, but it's a bit confusing.
