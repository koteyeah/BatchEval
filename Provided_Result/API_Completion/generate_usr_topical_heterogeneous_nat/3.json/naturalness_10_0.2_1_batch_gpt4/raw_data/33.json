is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

The speaker repeats the phrase \"he is a great player\" and \"he has a great record\" twice, which makes the response sound robotic.\n\nSample6: The response is natural and fits well with the conversation. It continues the topic of LeBron James' wealth and adds an interesting fact about Judge Judy.\n\nSample7: The response is unnatural and doesn't fit with the conversation.
