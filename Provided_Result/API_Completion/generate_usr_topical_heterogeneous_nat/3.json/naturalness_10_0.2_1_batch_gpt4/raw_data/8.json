i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ?

if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ?
