is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: really , i hope that is ok for us ?

i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i think it 's interesting that the violin made out of stone that was made out of stone that was invented by the dalton brothers .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you know much about presidents ?\nSpeaker A: i know they live in the white house !\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: nice . is that also true in ireland and france , where they have twin white house buildings ?\nSpeaker B: yeah but i do wonder if they presidents live in those houses or not\nSpeaker A: yeah , and since the white house still uses floppy disks , is this also true at the twin white houses ?\nSpeaker B: good point . i wonder if they use the floppy discs because they might still be safer\nSpeaker A: good question . perhaps , since teddy roosevelt banned christmas trees from the white house , perhaps bush issued an executive order against cds ?\nSpeaker B: well , it could be . good thing he brought back the solar panels though\nSpeaker A: true . although in 2011 , bullets struck the white house . it took the secret service 4 days to realize it . i wonder if the solar panels were damaged ?\nSpeaker B: good point and strange that they did not figure that out earlier\nSpeaker A: well , maybe they did n't notice because they were all inside listening to the latest pop music release from the president of indonesia ?\nSpeaker B: haha good point . did not know the guy released 3 albums already\nSpeaker A: the guy is a machine ! but he needs a better stage name . maybe president banana ?\nSpeaker B: i do not think the president of zimbabwe would be happy about that\nSpeaker A: he could be the artist formerly known as president banana ? i do n't really care as long as i can listen to him on the radio ! i love two things on my radio : indonesian pop music and electromagnetic storms from jupiter . those are my go to listening pleasures !\nSpeaker B: yeah that is so cool that if you turn your radio to am , you may capture jupiter 's storms\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how jupiter gets around the law in canada , where stations are required to play at least 40 % of their content from canadian artists . does jupiter have to book canadian storms ? \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i think it 's crazy that the highest scoring football game ever was 222 - 0 .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ? really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is very interesting , i do n't know how they could read that fast either .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: really , i hope that is ok for us ? i 'm also a big tech guy , how about you ? did you know new google employees are called \" nooglers \" . \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that facebook and twitter work together on some issues ? they are actually competitors .\nSpeaker A: no , i did n't know that . what kind of issues do they work together on ?\nSpeaker B: the baby sitter - rating system broke the social networks ' rules .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: oh i heard about that . somebody made an app to look at babysitter 's twitter and facebook in order to rate babysitters . that 's a big invasion of privacy and it 's great that facebook and twitter are fighting against it .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you know much about presidents ?\nSpeaker A: i know they live in the white house !\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: nice . is that also true in ireland and france , where they have twin white house buildings ?\nSpeaker B: yeah but i do wonder if they presidents live in those houses or not\nSpeaker A: yeah , and since the white house still uses floppy disks , is this also true at the twin white houses ?\nSpeaker B: good point . i wonder if they use the floppy discs because they might still be safer\nSpeaker A: good question . perhaps , since teddy roosevelt banned christmas trees from the white house , perhaps bush issued an executive order against cds ?\nSpeaker B: well , it could be . good thing he brought back the solar panels though\nSpeaker A: true . although in 2011 , bullets struck the white house . it took the secret service 4 days to realize it . i wonder if the solar panels were damaged ?\nSpeaker B: good point and strange that they did not figure that out earlier\nSpeaker A: well , maybe they did n't notice because they were all inside listening to the latest pop music release from the president of indonesia ?\nSpeaker B: haha good point . did not know the guy released 3 albums already\nSpeaker A: the guy is a machine ! but he needs a better stage name . maybe president banana ?\nSpeaker B: i do not think the president of zimbabwe would be happy about that\nSpeaker A: he could be the artist formerly known as president banana ?

when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ?
