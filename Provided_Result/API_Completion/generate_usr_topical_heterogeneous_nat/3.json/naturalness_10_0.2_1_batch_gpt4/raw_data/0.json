sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker A: i am well . i am learning about animals and how many there are on our planet . do you know how many ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea but would love to know .\nSpeaker A: there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number\nSpeaker B: wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ?\nSpeaker A: the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating !\nSpeaker B: you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .\nSpeaker A: wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ?\nSpeaker B: yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian .\nSpeaker A: interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ?\nSpeaker B: yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ...\nSpeaker A: it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ?\nSpeaker B: i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free\nSpeaker A: wow . i hope no one hiccups on the radio . do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think it is because it was from the old days of a fire hazard .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation

house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i did know that . i thought the director of the movie was edna mode , but the director did not find it very interesting .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess she walks backwards so maybe that she should not be free .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . \n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ? i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i would be curious . there is only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . i wonder who they are ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm not sure either . i do n't recall any african american artists in country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i used to play guitar . i have n't played in years though and was n't good . i had a gibson sg the kind that angus young from ac / dc plays . \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer

B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved

that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that

inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a great idea . i think it is a great way to keep track of things .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker A: i am well . i am learning about animals and how many there are on our planet . do you know how many ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea but would love to know .\nSpeaker A: there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number\nSpeaker B: wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ?\nSpeaker A: the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating !\nSpeaker B: you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .\nSpeaker A: wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ?\nSpeaker B: yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian .\nSpeaker A: interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ?\nSpeaker B: yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ...\nSpeaker A: it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ?\nSpeaker B: i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free\nSpeaker A: wow . i hope no one hiccups on the radio . do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think it is because it was from the old days of a fire hazard .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i did know that . i thought the director of the movie was edna mode , but the director did not find it very interesting .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess she walks backwards so maybe that she should not be free .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . \n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ? i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i would be curious . there is only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . i wonder who they are ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm not sure either . i do n't recall any african american artists in country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i used to play guitar . i have n't played in years though and was n't good . i had a gibson sg the kind that angus young from ac / dc plays . \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer

be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that

.\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i did know that . i thought the director of the movie was edna mode , but the director did not find it very interesting .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why

me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive ,

football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game .

sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker A: i am well . i am learning about animals and how many there are on our planet . do you know how many ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea but would love to

is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ?\nSpeaker A: the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating !\nSpeaker B: you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .\nSpeaker A: wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it

interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ?\nSpeaker B: yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ...\nSpeaker A: it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ?\nSpeaker B: i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free\nSpeaker A: wow . i hope no one hiccups on the radio . do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think it is because it was from the old days of a fire hazard .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation

house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i did know that . i thought the director of the movie was edna mode , but the director did not find it very interesting .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why

. the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess she walks backwards so maybe that she should not be free .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . \n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ? i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i would be curious . there is only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . i wonder who they are ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm not sure either . i do n't recall any african american artists in country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments

.\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow , i ca n't believe we 're destroying the world . if we viewed the earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only have existed for 1 minute and 17 seconds . and in that time , we 've managed to completely destroy the planet .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker A: i am well . i am learning about animals and how many there are on our planet . do you know how many ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea but would love to know .\nSpeaker A: there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number\nSpeaker B: wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ?\nSpeaker A: the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating !\nSpeaker B: you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .\nSpeaker A: wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ?\nSpeaker B: yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian .\nSpeaker A: interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ?\nSpeaker B: yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ...\nSpeaker A: it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ?\nSpeaker B: i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free\nSpeaker A: wow . i hope no one hiccups on the radio . do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think it is because it was from the old days of a fire hazard .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i did know that . i thought the director of the movie was edna mode , but the director did not find it very interesting .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess she walks backwards so maybe that she should not be free .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . \n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ? i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i would be curious . there is only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . i wonder who they are ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm not sure either . i do n't recall any african american artists in country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i used to play guitar . i have n't played in years though and was n't good . i had a gibson sg the kind that angus young from ac / dc plays . \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer
