the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think belichick is very strategic and he would n't do something if it would n't help his team win . the last time cleveland won a game in the playoffs was when belichick was their coach . shows how lucky teams are to have him .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ?

i do n't really care as long as i can listen to him on the radio ! i love two things on my radio : indonesian pop music and electromagnetic storms from jupiter . those are my go to listening pleasures !\nSpeaker B: yeah that is so cool that if you turn your radio to am , you may capture jupiter 's storms\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that might be banned in canada . the law says that all stations must have 40 % of the music played be canadian !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he was a great player . he was a great player . his sister was always better than him .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\nSpeaker A: i do nt even know what else they air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ; amazing !\nSpeaker A: i know right , seems crazy to have him in almost every one then to forget him completely in that one\nSpeaker B: do you still watch things on traditional tv ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: over the air maybe once or twice a year , i refuse to pay for a cable package to essentially pay them to advertise stuff to me \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i wonder if they have tested on the backs in the 1800s\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , how are you doing ? do you like xxxtentacion ?\nSpeaker A: i never heard of him . i understand that he had been fatally shot . how sad .\nSpeaker B: that is sad . i ve heard of him too , but never listened to the music .\nSpeaker A: apparently he had a number 1 hit posthumously\nSpeaker B: right and then more of his songs entered the top 100 . these eight are \" moonlight \" at no . 16 , \" changes \" at no . 18 , \" jocelyn flores \" at no . 19 , one with an unprintable title at no . 28 , \" everybody dies on their nightmares \" at no . 42 , \" the remedy for a broke heart ( why am i so in love ) \" at no . 58 , \" hope \" at no . 80 , and \" numb \" at no . 82 .\nSpeaker A: wow . that 's incredible . the lines of his song were sad talking about suicide\nSpeaker B: seems like a lot of musicians and actor / actress ' suffer from some kind of ailment . its so sad .\nSpeaker A: they 've got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work . rapper tupac shakur 's music is in the library of congress of \" cultural significance . \"\nSpeaker A: it takes death for things to happen and people realize the talent . when prince died his sales went up\nSpeaker B: absolutely kinda like a last tribute to them . before he became a rapper , eminem 's true dream was to become a comic\nSpeaker A: funny . did you know mcdonalds payed rappers $ 5 for everytime they referenced big macs in songs\nSpeaker B: what ! that s amazing . haha rapper busta rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the 1998 rugrats movie\nSpeaker A: that 's cool ! did you also know that there is a deaf rapper who rhymes in sign language . that is awesome\nSpeaker B: some rappers have a sign language translator on stage with them . i 've seen it on youtube !\nSpeaker A: that 's great ! the world 's fastest rapper noclue raps 14.1 syllables per second\nSpeaker B: korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle , it 's called \" compliment battle \" .\nSpeaker A: really , do they do compliments ?\nSpeaker B: i do nt know , but i am visiting korea in a few , so maybe i will find out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a great idea , i would like to listen to that one , i wonder how it sounds like\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
