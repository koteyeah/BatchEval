he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ? i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do ! i love shakespeare . i think he is a great actor and also a great writer\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ?

however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great player . he is the highest paid celebrity right ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not swim that much but i occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you know how the british only got breaststroke before ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: morning ! are you a comedy fan ?\nSpeaker A: morning ! yes , some of it . have you watched anything good recently ?\nSpeaker B: kung fu hustle . ever seen it ? it 's hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i have n't ! what is it about ? does it have bruce lee in it ?\nSpeaker B: no , it 's much more recent . steven chow directed it . bill murray loved it too .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i agree . i love the movie kung fu hustle .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ? he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ? i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do ! i love shakespeare . i think he is a great actor and also a great writer\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: basically the more clothes you wore the better you looked to others . \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ?

staying warm ?\nSpeaker A: trying just watching some netflix .. kyle kinane is hilarious .. one of my favorite comedies .\nSpeaker B: he is funny i know ! lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i love his comedy philosophy . he believes that comedians should n't tell people how the world works , because if they knew that they would n't be comedians ! he manages to be funny without lecturing the audience !\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ?
