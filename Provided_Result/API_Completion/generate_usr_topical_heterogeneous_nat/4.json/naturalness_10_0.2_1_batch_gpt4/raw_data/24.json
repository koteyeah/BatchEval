? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ?

he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ?

run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he was an all star and did the money . i think it 's interesting . i wonder how many albums he had .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello how are you doing ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ?

he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ?

really large , huh ?\nSpeaker A: that is interesting . gigantic . the sun is actually white , only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering\nSpeaker B: never knew that . the sun , though is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy even though so massive\nSpeaker A: that s crazy ! ! also , on july 11th , 2011 , neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 .. what a slow orbiting planet !\nSpeaker B: wow . i wonder who sits and stares to figure this out\nSpeaker A: right ! its really interesting though . facts i never knew about , i m learning so much from these chats .\nSpeaker B: yes , fun stuff . one lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun 5x hotter\nSpeaker A: that s insane , ca nt imagine what those people that have been struck by lightning felt like , eek .\nSpeaker B: really burnt unfortunately , may lose limbs from all that energy\nSpeaker A: crazy ! do you like books ? when you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama\nSpeaker B: really ? i like books a bunch but like exercise too . reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it . challenging for some .\nSpeaker A: do u speed read ? the world record for speed reading is held by anne jones , with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker B: not really , but i 'm pretty fast so maybe ? ? i would n't know how you tell . reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or do n't see things\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is very interesting , i do n't know how they could read that fast either .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think belichick is very strategic and he would n't do something if it would n't help his team win . the last time cleveland won a game in the playoffs was when belichick was their coach . shows how lucky teams are to have him .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have not . i have not . what is it about ?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is pretty cool . i guess it is supposed to run for 10,000 years , lol .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,\nSpeaker A: what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team .\nSpeaker B: well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach\nSpeaker A: john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ?\nSpeaker A: football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him .\nSpeaker B: maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he 's a great player . i think he 's a great player .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ?
