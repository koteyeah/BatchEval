i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: the \" t \" was invented for country music . they were introduced as the opening of the instrument .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he voiced edna mode , and yes , she is the only costume designer\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think you 're right . it was nice chatting with you .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ?
