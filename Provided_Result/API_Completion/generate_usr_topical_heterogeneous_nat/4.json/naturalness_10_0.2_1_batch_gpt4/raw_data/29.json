i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i 'm sure there are some violin out there .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ?

pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: qbs are often very smart . brad johnson is the only qb in history to throw a touchdown pass to himself ! imagine the brains it takes to pull that off .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ? i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i would be curious . there is only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . i wonder who they are ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm not sure either . i do n't recall any african american artists in country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do love the guitar . did you know u2 opened for themselves ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ;)\nSpeaker A: hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising .\nSpeaker B: does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising !\nSpeaker B: actress ? i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i 'm sure there are some violin out there .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've ever been able to afford one . i do n't have a kindle , but i do n't have a kindle .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ?

that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha , that is awesome . a cat named stubbs is the mayor in a town in alaska .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . did you know the president of indonesia is a pop star ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
