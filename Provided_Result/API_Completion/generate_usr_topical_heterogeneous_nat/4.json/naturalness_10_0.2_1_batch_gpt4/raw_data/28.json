if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ?
