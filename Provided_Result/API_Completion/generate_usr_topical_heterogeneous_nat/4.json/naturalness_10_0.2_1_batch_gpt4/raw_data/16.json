i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ?
