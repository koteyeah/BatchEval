he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ?
