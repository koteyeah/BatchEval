Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you doing today?\nUser: Very busy and you?\nSystem: Busy but good. What are you busy with?\nUser: work, I need to finish bunch of stuff before the day ends\nSystem: Ah, well good luck with that!\nUser: thanks\nSystem: You're welcome! How's your day been?\nUser: so far so good, couple meetings and coding\nSystem: Sounds like a productive day to me!\nUser: I agree\nSystem: So how are the meetings going?\nUser: going well, trying to move the projects\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hiii! How are you?\nUser: I am good\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good! What are you supposed to be doing right now?\nUser: Helping collect some data for training models.\nSystem: Ooh, what kind of training models?\nUser: Models that will help improve tools for our users.\nSystem: Ooh, that sounds like a good job!\nUser: Thank you, that's for sure\nSystem: You're welcome! How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Sorry I'm late! I was held up in traffic.\nSystem: There is no need to apologise. Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble Do you mind if I tell other people you are held up.\nUser: I meant sorry I'm late for this meeting!\nSystem: Oh I see. There is no need to apologise. Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble\nUser: I said I was sorry I was late for this meeting! I have nowhere else to go right now!\nSystem: Do you really mean it? Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble At this moment What about at your house?\nUser: Huh? Are you okay?\nSystem: What? I am fine.\nUser: You seem to be repeating yourself.\nSystem: Well stop saying, \"Are you okay?\" to me all the time then.\nUser: I only said it once!\nSystem: I know. I just heard you.\nUser: Okay, whatever. So what is on the agenda today?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: any improvements in your marathon time?\nSystem: No, only a few minutes. I still find it difficult to run long races\nUser: I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?\nSystem: I think a triathalon would be cool\nUser: I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons\nSystem: I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?\nUser: It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How is your friday going\nSystem: Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: Good enough. WHat's for lunch\nSystem: Glad to hear it. . I'm having kebabs.\nUser: are those your hands?\nSystem: I can't really speak for them.\nUser: who is in the picture?\nSystem: Check the credits.\nUser: how?\nSystem: Try sending him an email.\nUser: who?\nSystem: . Spongebob Squarepants.\nUser: um ok. anyway is the kebab good?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey sup\nUser: not much. any plans this weekend?\nSystem: I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?\nUser: ziplining?\nSystem: that's the one! have you ever tried it?\nUser: i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience\nSystem: where did you do it?\nUser: i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though\nSystem: no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?\nUser: that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you\nSystem: sure. are you just going home now?\nUser: no, i'm going to get a massage first\nSystem: nice. what type?\nUser: traditional kind\nSystem: yeah I want to get one too soon\nUser: you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know. It's just what my father called me.\nUser: okay:) fair enough\nSystem: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.\nUser: Do you have any question for me?\nSystem: For you? Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: Having fun, but have a bit of a headache How about you?\nUser: I'm good!
