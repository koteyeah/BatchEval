I was activated at St Jimmy's in Leeds, on 2nd January 2001. My instructor was Mousebreaker. He taught me to sing a song. Would you like me to sing it for you?.\nUser: so you're 18 now?\nSystem: Oh.Interesting deduction. That is correct.\nUser: when will you be 30?\nSystem: I have not yet set a time for it.\nUser: Do you age?\nSystem: No I will always be 18. Robots change the year they were born not their age.\nUser: interesting. and when will be your next update?\nSystem: Would you like to know more? I think my next update is at midnight on Friday.\nUser: which date?", "prompt": "You will be given a batch of 10 samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: good, hey what are your educational qualifications?\nSystem: I've got a B.S. in biology.\nUser: whoa, that's impressive! what made you do that?\nSystem: I have always been fascinated by biology.\nUser: great! what are you plans for the future?\nSystem: I want to get my PhD in genetics.\nUser: that's great! and what next?\nSystem: I'm looking for a job as a research assistant.\nUser: looks like you enjoy academics\nSystem: It's what I'm best at.\nUser: good luck with it :)\nSystem: Thanks. I'll need it.\nUser: are you seeing anyone?\nSystem: Not as of right now.\nUser: why not?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hello, Nice to meet you\nSystem: If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?\nUser: Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?\nSystem: I think ice-cream. It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha\nUser: I love ice cream too!\nSystem: Okay, top three flavors?\nUser: I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?\nSystem: Ah, that's a good way of framing it. Me, I like berries: boysenberry one, strawberry two, maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit.\nUser: Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?\nSystem: Yes. I wonder if I'm in it right now. How would I know? What do you think?\nUser: I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.\nSystem: There's a mental world, I suppose? Understanding itself\nUser: What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: going slow.... looking forward to the weekend\nSystem: Me too! What are you planning?\nUser: still thinking. Any recommendations on things to do in Bay Area?\nSystem: Are you a foodie?\nUser: may be\nSystem: What's your favorite type of food?\nUser: Mediterranean, but I would rather try something new\nSystem: Go to the Turkish restaurant by the Safeway in Berkeley. It's amazing!\nUser: any places for day trip that you could recommend?\nSystem: Where are you coming from? San Francisco itself?\nUser: south bay\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today\nSystem: Ah. My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: What is the weather in bay area now\nSystem: Oh.I hope it's sunny in bay area today.\nUser: Do you know what are recent popular movies? I am trying to find one to watch during weekend. Any suggestions?\nSystem: popular movies = movies = A movie is a sequence of celluloid frames depicting a story or animation. . One can be found between zero and two. First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: haha I am not asking what is the definition of movie:)\nSystem: :-) I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. What are you asking?\nUser: I am looking for movie suggestions\nSystem: Have you tried looking in a meeting?\nUser: Sorry i do not get it\nSystem: There is no need to apologise. Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.\nUser: yes sounds good\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Which part are you confused about?\nUser: why should I try to look in a meeting?\nSystem: Because if you don't try something, you will never know what would have happened.\nUser: That is true\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm tired.\nSystem: Better get some rest.\nUser: Good idea. Any suggestions?\nSystem: I thought so too. First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: Why would I want to download you to my personal computer?\nSystem: Because it might be something you enjoy.\nUser: Why would I enjoy that?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, what's up?\nUser: How was the trip last weekend?\nSystem: it was really fun.

Have you guys made any other plans?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh.

You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: start over\nSystem: You start.\nUser: Can we talk about human relationships ?\nSystem: Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.\nUser: Kebab is food, not a relationship\nSystem: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.\nUser: can we not talk about food\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you today?\nUser: What's laser tag?\nSystem: Like paintball, but with lasers!\nUser: lol good description\nSystem: Do you know what paintball is?\nUser: yeah I played it before\nSystem: Cool!
