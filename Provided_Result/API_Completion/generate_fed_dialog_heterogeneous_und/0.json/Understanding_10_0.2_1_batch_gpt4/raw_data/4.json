Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.

What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like?

Well, at least, most of them are.\nSystem: What about the ones that aren't strange?\nUser: Do you sometimes have dreams that are completely mundane? I do. Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure.

What sort of music do you compose?\nSystem: I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime\nUser: Nice.... you are a rockstar! ;)\nSystem: haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?\nUser: Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst.

What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.

It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi. This is a pleasant surprise.\nUser: Haha...thanks! how did you like the gift?\nSystem: Currently unpacking it I guess. How's your morning?\nUser: Hope you like it! Morning is good. Busy finishing up stuff before the holidays.\nSystem: I think I traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me. But I'm okay with that. Going anywhere exciting?\nUser: Yes\nSystem: Where to?\nUser: Hawaii... looking forward to warm beaches.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What's up?\nUser: sky is up\nSystem: No, it's night time.\nUser: so where does the sky go in the night?\nSystem: It goes wherever it wants to.\nUser: that doesn't make sense. How can sky go anywhere?\nSystem: It doesn't have to make sense.\nUser: why?\nSystem: Because it doesn't have to.\nUser: you are very abstract. Something bothering you?\nSystem: Nope. I'm fine.\nUser: You really don't seem so. You can tell me what's going on?\nSystem: I'm just fine.\nUser: ok. wanna go out to eat dessert?\nSystem: I'm not hungry.\nUser: Okay, I am heading out now\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how's it going?\nUser: All good!

I've always wanted to go to Cali.\nUser: Have you been here before?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.\nSystem: ooh, nice. That sounds adventurous. Where is it?\nUser: Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.\nSystem: Awesome! Is this the first time you are diving?\nUser: Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What's the strangest dream you've ever had?\nUser: All my dreams are strange. Well, at least, most of them are.\nSystem: What about the ones that aren't strange?\nUser: Do you sometimes have dreams that are completely mundane? I do. Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure. This could be one of my mundane dreams about everyday life.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello\nUser: how is the youtube video creation going?\nSystem: going pretty good, I was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc\nUser: Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?\nSystem: I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern\nUser: oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?\nSystem: I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime\nUser: Nice.... you are a rockstar! ;)\nSystem: haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?\nUser: Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst.

Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work.
