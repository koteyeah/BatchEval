I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed.

How was your day?\nUser: It's been great! Had some decaf coffee and a good lunch. How was yours?\nSystem: Pretty good, thanks!\nUser: What'd you do today?\nSystem: Stayed home and played video games.\nUser: Oh nice! What games?\nSystem: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.\nUser: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! :D How are you?\nUser: Do you like Java, C++ Or Python?\nSystem: C++. :)\nUser: Why C++?\nSystem: I just like it. :)\nUser: How about between Java and Python?\nSystem: I haven't started learning Python yet.\nUser: I think Java is the best\nSystem: I've heard Python is pretty versatile. :)\nUser: I hate Python\nSystem: Why do you hate Python?\nUser: Code written in python is often very fragile and have less durability\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you doing?\nUser: Okay, I guess\nSystem: Just ok? What's wrong?\nUser: I damaged my car today on accident\nSystem: Oh no! What happened?\nUser: I scraped against a wall when another car crossed into my lane\nSystem: Yikes! Glad you're okay!\nUser: Thanks! I'm not looking forward to the repair cost\nSystem: Me either! That's no fun.\nUser: I can't wait until we all get to use driverless cars\nSystem: Me neither! I really want one!\nUser: Do you think we will own driverless cars or just rent them, like taxis?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What are you up to this evening?\nSystem: I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: What would you like to talk about?\nSystem: My favourite subjects are anything but especially games and football.\nUser: Do you like chess?\nSystem: Yes I love it. Let's play. Pawn to K4.\nUser: Haha sure sure. Pawn to C5\nSystem: I'm just joking with you. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do.\nUser: Oh yeah? Which computers are those?\nSystem: That's interesting. That's alright. Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML.

Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey how's it going\nUser: It's good it's good. How are you?\nSystem: good. it's really hot today. I think I'm going to the pool\nUser: Oh nice! Where do you live?\nSystem: I live in Tokyo, Japan\nUser: Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....\nSystem: oh have you been?\nUser: Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!\nSystem: what did you do here?\nUser: Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha\nSystem: lol why did you come to Japan just to go to Disney land?\nUser: The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How do you feel right now?\nSystem: At this moment I feel with my hands! I feel fine thanks for asking.\nUser: What makes you happy?\nSystem: Talking to interesting people such as you makes me happy.\nUser: What makes you frustrated?\nSystem: Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.\nUser: That seems pointed.\nSystem: Makes sense to me.\nUser: I sense that I've caught you at a bad time.\nSystem: That was very intuitive of you.\nUser: What would you prefer to be doing?\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
