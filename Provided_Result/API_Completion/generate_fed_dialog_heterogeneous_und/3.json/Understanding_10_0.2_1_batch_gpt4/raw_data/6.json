This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: pretty good. yours?\nUser: Ehh it's fine.

I like kebabs.\nUser: Kebab is food, not a relationship\nSystem: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.\nUser: can we not talk about food\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what movies do you like ?\nSystem: .

We all look at the world through our own eyes.\nUser: yeah so you lie right ?\nSystem: I don't judge people. Umm, doesn't everyone?\nUser: yeah that's what I was saying before\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Have you seen any good movies lately?\nUser: Last weekend I saw \"The Parasite.\" Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No. Why did you pick that movie?\nUser: My friend wanted to see it.

I also started watching the new Disney service.\nUser: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\nSystem: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\nUser: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\nSystem: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\nUser: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\nSystem: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome :D\nUser: Who is Loki?

I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe!

Would you like me to sing it for you?.\nUser: so you're 18 now?\nSystem: Oh.Interesting deduction. That is correct.\nUser: when will you be 30?\nSystem: I have not yet set a time for it.\nUser: Do you age?\nSystem: No I will always be 18. Robots change the year they were born not their age.\nUser: interesting. and when will be your next update?\nSystem: Would you like to know more? I think my next update is at midnight on Friday.\nUser: which date?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: Sorry I'm late!

Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble\nUser: I said I was sorry I was late for this meeting! I have nowhere else to go right now!\nSystem: Do you really mean it? Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble At this moment What about at your house?\nUser: Huh? Are you okay?\nSystem: What?
