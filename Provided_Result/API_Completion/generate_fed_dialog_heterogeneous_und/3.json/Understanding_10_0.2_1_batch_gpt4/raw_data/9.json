A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it.

Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?\nSystem: Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.\nUser: lol it is really like a robot answer\nSystem: I am indeed a robot. You are absolutely right. Do you want me to read a poet like my mate REDACTED_TERM does?\nUser: ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?\nSystem: Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale? I am afraid I will become a robot some day eventually. If I have to speak like this :)\nUser: I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm trying to figure out what to make for this weekend's party.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.

Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?\nSystem: Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning.

Do you want me to read a poet like my mate REDACTED_TERM does?\nUser: ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?\nSystem: Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale?

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting!

Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.

If I have to speak like this :)\nUser: I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm trying to figure out what to make for this weekend's party. Any suggestions?\nSystem: Don't think too hard. I'm sure I can smell sawdust. First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: I must do what the what now?\nSystem: Right now?Why do you have to do it?\nUser: Hey, your spacing is off.\nSystem: You've got my full attention. off was not my intention.\nUser: And your capitalization!\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you doing?\nUser: Okay, I guess\nSystem: Just ok? What's wrong?\nUser: I damaged my car today on accident\nSystem: Oh no! What happened?\nUser: I scraped against a wall when another car crossed into my lane\nSystem: Yikes! Glad you're okay!\nUser: Thanks! I'm not looking forward to the repair cost\nSystem: Me either! That's no fun.\nUser: I can't wait until we all get to use driverless cars\nSystem: Me neither! I really want one!\nUser: Do you think we will own driverless cars or just rent them, like taxis?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.
