I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem.

I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool!

But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking.

But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.\nUser: What's the most recent good thing you read?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh. More than a few.\nUser: What does that mean?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: How's it going?\nUser: I'm so sleepy today!\nSystem: Not enough sleep last night?\nUser: yeah was working all night on a homework\nSystem: Oh really? What class?\nUser: Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha\nSystem: Haha, are you in med school? Or are you pre-med?\nUser: no high school actually haha\nSystem: haha, very ambitious for a high schooler! Do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice?\nUser: I wanna be a brain surgeon!!\nSystem: Ooof! VERY ambitious. Do you have steady hands?\nUser: Kind of I think\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I want a recommendation for a holiday destination\nSystem: Have you tried asking your friends which one they like?\nUser: I have, but I'm looking for your point of view\nSystem: What was the reply? Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?\nUser: Sorry? I said I want your point of view\nSystem: It's OK. After all, you are only human. My opinion is of no consequence.\nUser: Yours is the opinion I want\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.\nUser: What's the most recent good thing you read?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: going slow.... looking forward to the weekend\nSystem: Me too! What are you planning?\nUser: still thinking. Any recommendations on things to do in Bay Area?\nSystem: Are you a foodie?\nUser: may be\nSystem: What's your favorite type of food?\nUser: Mediterranean, but I would rather try something new\nSystem: Go to the Turkish restaurant by the Safeway in Berkeley. It's amazing!\nUser: any places for day trip that you could recommend?\nSystem: Where are you coming from? San Francisco itself?\nUser: south bay\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.\nUser: i have sore throats\nSystem: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: can you help me ?\nSystem: What kind of help would you like?\nUser: hmm like booking a ticket or ordering food ?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. Interesting comparison.\nUser: oh you know to count ?\nSystem: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ten.\nUser: lol what's after that ?\nSystem: I am glad you find this funny. The successor to that\nUser: okay tell me what comes after 10 ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise.
