What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like?

How are you today?\nUser: What's laser tag?\nSystem: Like paintball, but with lasers!\nUser: lol good description\nSystem: Do you know what paintball is?\nUser: yeah I played it before\nSystem: Cool!

What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did.

It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you today?\nUser: What's laser tag?\nSystem: Like paintball, but with lasers!\nUser: lol good description\nSystem: Do you know what paintball is?\nUser: yeah I played it before\nSystem: Cool!

What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did.

I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea.

Do you work as well?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?\nSystem: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?\nUser: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you today?\nUser: What's laser tag?\nSystem: Like paintball, but with lasers!\nUser: lol good description\nSystem: Do you know what paintball is?\nUser: yeah I played it before\nSystem: Cool!

What's your name?\nSystem: I'm Alyssa. What's yours? :)\nUser: Don't wanna say. Do you like music?\nSystem: Yeah I like music! What about you?\nUser: Yep. What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did.

I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How was your day?\nUser: It was pretty good, thanks.

They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did. The Wikipedia page even says that it's \"a song by the India rock band alt-J\". REDACTED_LINK\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you today?\nUser: It's Friday, Friday, Friday :D\nSystem: YAY! I love Fridays!\nUser: Do you like Rebecca Black's Friday?\nSystem: She's okay. I prefer Friday by Rebecca Sugar.\nUser: okay. How does that song go?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: show me your humanlike part\nSystem: Why do you want to see my humanlike part?\nUser: because that's what you described yourself as\nSystem: Yes. Did I clear things up for you?\nUser: nope, because you haven't answered my question\nSystem: Fair enough. I thought I possibly did but I guess I was mistaken. I did but I was just giving sarcastic replies.\nUser: do you remember my original request?\nSystem: Is this a trick question?\nUser: nope, it's a memory question\nSystem: It seems like a trick to me. Perhaps there is a memory answer?\nUser: okay, I try again, say something human-like to me\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello. How's your week coming along?\nUser: It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.\nSystem: Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?\nUser: I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How was your day?\nUser: It was pretty good, thanks. I thought I was getting a cold but I'm determined to beat it tomorrow.\nSystem: Oh no! I hope you feel better!  \u2047\nUser: Yeah, starting to feel better already. Thanks!\nSystem: Oh good! Glad to hear it!\nUser: Do you have a strong constitution?\nSystem: I hope so! Why do you ask?\nUser: Just curious. So you don't get sick a lot?\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
