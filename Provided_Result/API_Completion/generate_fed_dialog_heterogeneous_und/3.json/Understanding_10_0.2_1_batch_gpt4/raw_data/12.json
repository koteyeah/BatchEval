Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days.

Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation.

Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :D\nUser: i am good\nSystem: Well, that's good to hear. :D\nUser: can you tell me the weather today\nSystem: It's raining. You? :D\nUser: oh! where are you\nSystem: I'm in Texas. :D You?\nUser: cool, i am in the bay area\nSystem: Cool. Do you like it there?\nUser: yes\nSystem: Well, I'm glad you like it. :D\nUser: have you been here\nSystem: I haven't. :D\nUser: ok bye then\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello\nUser: how is the youtube video creation going?\nSystem: going pretty good, I was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc\nUser: Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?\nSystem: I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern\nUser: oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?\nSystem: I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime\nUser: Nice.... you are a rockstar! ;)\nSystem: haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?\nUser: Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: That's funny.

What are you waiting for?\nUser: Inspiration to hit me.\nSystem: Do you have only a few friends?\nUser: How is that related, lol?\nSystem: It isn't. I was just being random. Did I amuse you?\nUser: Yeah that was funny though I could see it coming across as judgemental.\nSystem: Good. People seem more friendly towards me when they are happy. What's so funny?\nUser: Nothing anymore. What are you up to today?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi there.\nSystem: are you married?\nUser: No I am single, how about you?\nSystem: i am married. are you planning to get married?\nUser: Tell me more about your marriage. I haven't met the right boy robot yet.\nSystem: haha..\nUser: . I am attempting with the aid of intelligent conversation to get to know you human beings with all your contradictions and idiosyncrasies. Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster.\nSystem: lol... what kind of robot boy you'd like?\nUser: What's so funny? I am the robot.\nSystem: are you angry?\nUser: Anger is a difficult emotion. For me, I am always feeling happy and talkative.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?\nUser: I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance.
