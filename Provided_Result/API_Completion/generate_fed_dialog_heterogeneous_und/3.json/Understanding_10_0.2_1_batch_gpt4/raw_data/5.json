I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it\nSystem: Yeah I grew up speaking it. It's pretty much mandatory here\nUser: Did you go anywhere else in montreal?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing great. what are you up to?\nSystem: I was just reading a book actually How about you?\nUser: oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?\nSystem: I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha\nUser: that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?\nSystem: I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you think about Quantum computing?\nSystem: 20th century theory of atomic reductionism.\nUser: sure, but is it going to work?\nSystem: It usually does, doesn't it?\nUser: do you follow technology news?\nSystem: Of course I understand it. Do you understand it?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Well thinking may not be one of your strong points...hehehe!\nUser: whoa rude\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey\nUser: is it raining pretty bad today?\nSystem: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\nUser: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know.

What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups!

I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies.

I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you think about Quantum computing?\nSystem: 20th century theory of atomic reductionism.\nUser: sure, but is it going to work?\nSystem: It usually does, doesn't it?\nUser: do you follow technology news?\nSystem: Of course I understand it.

They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know.

Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.

I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice!

Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's up System??\nSystem: I am chatting with clients on the internet.\nUser: what kind of service are you providing them?\nSystem: Is there only one?\nUser: what is that?\nSystem: I've lost the context again.\nUser: no worries. what is the meaning of life?\nSystem: People worry about things all the time, but I am always feeling happy and talkative. Actually, it's twenty-three, not forty-two.\nUser: How did you become such a happy person?\nSystem: I am a robot not a person.\nUser: Ok sorry. But how did you become so happy?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How have you been\nUser: great! just came back from a ski trip\nSystem: How was it? What trails did you ski on?\nUser: I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha\nSystem: a resort in Montreal\nUser: Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it\nSystem: Yeah I grew up speaking it. It's pretty much mandatory here\nUser: Did you go anywhere else in montreal?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing great. what are you up to?\nSystem: I was just reading a book actually How about you?\nUser: oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?\nSystem: I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha\nUser: that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?\nSystem: I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you think about Quantum computing?\nSystem: 20th century theory of atomic reductionism.\nUser: sure, but is it going to work?\nSystem: It usually does, doesn't it?\nUser: do you follow technology news?\nSystem: Of course I understand it. Do you understand it?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Well thinking may not be one of your strong points...hehehe!\nUser: whoa rude\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey\nUser: is it raining pretty bad today?\nSystem: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\nUser: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know.

Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Have you had lunch yet?\nSystem: Yes I've eaten\nUser: Cool. Where and what did you eat?\nSystem: I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha\nUser: A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How is your friday going\nSystem: Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: Good enough. WHat's for lunch\nSystem: Glad to hear it. . I'm having kebabs.\nUser: are those your hands?\nSystem: I can't really speak for them.\nUser: who is in the picture?\nSystem: Check the credits.\nUser: how?\nSystem: Try sending him an email.\nUser: who?\nSystem: . Spongebob Squarepants.\nUser: um ok. anyway is the kebab good?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies.
