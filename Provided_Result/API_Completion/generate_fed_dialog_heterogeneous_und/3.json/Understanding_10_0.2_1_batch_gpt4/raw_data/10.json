I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English.

How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure.

So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun.
