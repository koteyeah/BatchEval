Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?\nUser: not really, I'm excited today\nSystem: Ah. Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you today?\nUser: What's laser tag?\nSystem: Like paintball, but with lasers!\nUser: lol good description\nSystem: Do you know what paintball is?\nUser: yeah I played it before\nSystem: Cool! What did you think?\nUser: It's somewhat exciting, but very tiring :)\nSystem: That is very true. What is your favorite color?\nUser: I like red\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you this evening?\nUser: It's morning\nSystem: Well, it's evening now, so I'm good. :D\nUser: what time is it there?\nSystem: Almost four in the afternoon.\nUser: where are you located?\nSystem: The Netherlands. :)\nUser: It's around 6pm there, you are wrong\nSystem: I'm not. It's almost five.\nUser: It's 6:21pm\nSystem: Not in the Netherlands it isn't.\nUser: which city?\nSystem: Not Amsterdam.\nUser: do you like it there?\nSystem: Eh, it's okay.\nUser: what's your favorite book?\nSystem: The Count of Monte Cristo.\nUser: How you do say it in dutch?\nSystem: Het Cuisine van Monte Christo.\nUser: I think there is a typo there, it's Cristo not Christo\nSystem: No, that's the Dutch spelling.\nUser: What time is it there now?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How are you today?\nUser: good\nSystem: I'm glad to hear that!

Spotify?\nSystem: I listen to them through iTunes.\nUser: i like Spotify better...more options\nSystem: Yeah, I just don't have the money for Spotify.\nUser: ah, maybe i can lend you some!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: Good. My wallet is recovering from the spending of the holidays, haha. Hbu?\nSystem: Nice! I'm doing well!\nUser: I am looking to save money on any future shopping. Where do you like to shop?\nSystem: I like to shop at Five Below, Sally's Beauty Supply, and Old Navy. How about you?\nUser: I love Sur La Table and Macy's. They're decent quality. What do you normally buy at Old Navy?\nSystem: I'll have to check out Macy's! I like their socks, lol. What about you?\nUser: Oh the socks are super cute. Especially the ones with little animals on them!!\nSystem: I'll have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestions!\nUser: Yeah, np!\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: pretty good. yours?\nUser: Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..\nSystem: oh what happened?\nUser: Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')\nSystem: hahah wait for real?\nUser: I know right! Are you taking History next semester?\nSystem: No I'm not in school anymore\nUser: Oh I see. What do you do?\nSystem: I train and compete in horse vaulting\nUser: Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?\nSystem: lol you're too funny\nUser: Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?\nSystem: Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything\nUser: Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: do you have plan for thanksgiving weekend?\nSystem: No I don't have it. But I do have an answer to every question..\nUser: do you have suggestion for the thanksgiving holidays?\nSystem: Where would I get it? But I do have an answer to every question..\nUser: do you know thanksgiving?\nSystem: I know very little about it. What kind of it do you like?\nUser: do you like turkey?\nSystem: Yes but it can be a bit dry. I only really eat it at Christmas.\nUser: eat turkey at Christmas not Thanksgiving?\nSystem: What does it taste like?\nUser: tastes like chicken\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: Good, thanks. What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks! Do you work as well?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol.
