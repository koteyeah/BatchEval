I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?\nSystem: I haven't Honestly I probably wouldn't be able to identify which sport they played\nUser: Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well!

Do I know it?\nUser: what do you do on weekends ?\nSystem: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.\nUser: what's your favorite language\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today\nSystem: Ah.

Perhaps I can explain it again better.\nUser: yes sounds good\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Which part are you confused about?\nUser: why should I try to look in a meeting?\nSystem: Because if you don't try something, you will never know what would have happened.\nUser: That is true\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!

I still find it difficult to run long races\nUser: I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?\nSystem: I think a triathalon would be cool\nUser: I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons\nSystem: I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?\nUser: It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How is your friday going\nSystem: Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: Good enough.

I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh.

I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.
