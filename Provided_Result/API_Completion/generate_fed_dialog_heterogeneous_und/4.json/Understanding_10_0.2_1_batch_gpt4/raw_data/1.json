What kind of music do you like?\nSystem: I like mostly rock music and pop music, but lately I've been listening to a bunch of Alt-J and Childish Gambino. You?\nUser: My tastes are pretty eclectic. Which Childish Gambino songs do you like?\nSystem: 3005 and Telegraph Ave.\nUser: I've never heard of Alt-J before. Can you tell me about them?\nSystem: Sure, they're a fantastic indie band. They have a new album coming out soon so I figured I'd check them out.\nUser: What's the album called?\nSystem: Breezeblocks, I think.\nUser: I tried Googling it, and I think that's a song, not an album.\nSystem: Try looking up \"Alt-J - Breezeblocks\"\nUser: That's what I just did.
