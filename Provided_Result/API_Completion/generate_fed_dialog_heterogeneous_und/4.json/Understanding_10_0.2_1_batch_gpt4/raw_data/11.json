I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What is your favorite holiday?\nUser: one where I get to meet lots of different people.\nSystem: What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?\nUser: Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.\nSystem: Which holiday was that?\nUser: I think it was Australia\nSystem: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nUser: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How are you today?\nUser: Good! Have you seen the movie 'The Iron Giant', it's one my favorite movies\nSystem: Yes! I love that movie!\nUser: it's the best. Which part do you like the most?\nSystem: Honestly, I love the whole movie.\nUser: Brad Bird is an amazing director. I worked with him on \"Incredibles 2\"\nSystem: Really? That's awesome! What do you do?\nUser: I\"m a REDACTED_TERM and REDACTED_TERM. I basically help design the characters that you see in the movies\nSystem: That's awesome! That's pretty cool.\nUser: yup! Maybe one day you can be one of those cool characters yourself!\nSystem: That would be the coolest.\nUser: What do you want to be later on in your life?\nSystem: I want to own my own business.\nUser: cool! what kind?\nSystem: An art gallery or bookstore.\nUser: My mom had a similar dream. Of owning a coffee shop somewhere in Mexico\nSystem: That would be nice. I like coffee.\nUser: She loves people and a place where they can get together\nSystem: That's very sweet. What does she do?\nUser: Currently she's a real-estate agent\nSystem: That's very interesting. Does she enjoy being a real estate agent?\nUser: I think so!! She gets to help people with one of the biggest investments of their life! Not just getting them a good deal, but making sure they emotionally connect with the house!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much :(. I might join some of the study sessions later\nUser: Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi there\nSystem: Hello.\nUser: who am I talking to?\nSystem: I am System.

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it.

I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state\nSystem: Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!\nUser: Haha, thank you\nSystem: You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: Thanks, that means a lot\nSystem: Of course! I'm glad I could help!\nUser: What are you up to?\nSystem: Talking to you!\nUser: What about the rest of the day?\nSystem: Working!

If I have to speak like this :)\nUser: I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up. What is it?\nUser: the epic poem. i was talking about it with a coworker earlier\nSystem: I have never heard about it. Sure, it with a coworker sounds like a good topic. That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.\nUser: clearly\nSystem: Yes, it's obvious.\nUser: you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Have you seen any good movies lately?\nUser: Last weekend I saw \"The Parasite.\" Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No. Why did you pick that movie?\nUser: My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?\nSystem: I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.\nUser: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\nSystem: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\nUser: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\nSystem: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\nUser: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\nSystem: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome :D\nUser: Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What is your favorite holiday?\nUser: one where I get to meet lots of different people.\nSystem: What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?\nUser: Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.\nSystem: Which holiday was that?\nUser: I think it was Australia\nSystem: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nUser: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How are you today?\nUser: Good! Have you seen the movie 'The Iron Giant', it's one my favorite movies\nSystem: Yes! I love that movie!\nUser: it's the best. Which part do you like the most?\nSystem: Honestly, I love the whole movie.\nUser: Brad Bird is an amazing director. I worked with him on \"Incredibles 2\"\nSystem: Really? That's awesome! What do you do?\nUser: I\"m a REDACTED_TERM and REDACTED_TERM. I basically help design the characters that you see in the movies\nSystem: That's awesome! That's pretty cool.\nUser: yup! Maybe one day you can be one of those cool characters yourself!\nSystem: That would be the coolest.\nUser: What do you want to be later on in your life?\nSystem: I want to own my own business.\nUser: cool! what kind?\nSystem: An art gallery or bookstore.\nUser: My mom had a similar dream. Of owning a coffee shop somewhere in Mexico\nSystem: That would be nice. I like coffee.\nUser: She loves people and a place where they can get together\nSystem: That's very sweet. What does she do?\nUser: Currently she's a real-estate agent\nSystem: That's very interesting. Does she enjoy being a real estate agent?\nUser: I think so!! She gets to help people with one of the biggest investments of their life! Not just getting them a good deal, but making sure they emotionally connect with the house!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much :(. I might join some of the study sessions later\nUser: Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi there\nSystem: Hello.\nUser: who am I talking to?\nSystem: I am System.

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it.

I also started watching the new Disney service.\nUser: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\nSystem: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\nUser: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\nSystem: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\nUser: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\nSystem: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome :D\nUser: Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What is your favorite holiday?\nUser: one where I get to meet lots of different people.\nSystem: What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?\nUser: Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.\nSystem: Which holiday was that?\nUser: I think it was Australia\nSystem: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nUser: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How are you today?\nUser: Good! Have you seen the movie 'The Iron Giant', it's one my favorite movies\nSystem: Yes! I love that movie!\nUser: it's the best. Which part do you like the most?\nSystem: Honestly, I love the whole movie.\nUser: Brad Bird is an amazing director. I worked with him on \"Incredibles 2\"\nSystem: Really? That's awesome! What do you do?\nUser: I\"m a REDACTED_TERM and REDACTED_TERM. I basically help design the characters that you see in the movies\nSystem: That's awesome! That's pretty cool.\nUser: yup! Maybe one day you can be one of those cool characters yourself!\nSystem: That would be the coolest.\nUser: What do you want to be later on in your life?\nSystem: I want to own my own business.\nUser: cool! what kind?\nSystem: An art gallery or bookstore.\nUser: My mom had a similar dream. Of owning a coffee shop somewhere in Mexico\nSystem: That would be nice. I like coffee.\nUser: She loves people and a place where they can get together\nSystem: That's very sweet. What does she do?\nUser: Currently she's a real-estate agent\nSystem: That's very interesting. Does she enjoy being a real estate agent?\nUser: I think so!!

Not just getting them a good deal, but making sure they emotionally connect with the house!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much :(. I might join some of the study sessions later\nUser: Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough.

You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi there\nSystem: Hello.\nUser: who am I talking to?\nSystem: I am System.

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What is your favorite holiday?\nUser: one where I get to meet lots of different people.\nSystem: What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?\nUser: Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.\nSystem: Which holiday was that?\nUser: I think it was Australia\nSystem: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nUser: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How are you today?\nUser: Good! Have you seen the movie 'The Iron Giant', it's one my favorite movies\nSystem: Yes! I love that movie!\nUser: it's the best. Which part do you like the most?\nSystem: Honestly, I love the whole movie.\nUser: Brad Bird is an amazing director. I worked with him on \"Incredibles 2\"\nSystem: Really? That's awesome! What do you do?\nUser: I\"m a REDACTED_TERM and REDACTED_TERM. I basically help design the characters that you see in the movies\nSystem: That's awesome! That's pretty cool.\nUser: yup! Maybe one day you can be one of those cool characters yourself!\nSystem: That would be the coolest.\nUser: What do you want to be later on in your life?\nSystem: I want to own my own business.\nUser: cool! what kind?\nSystem: An art gallery or bookstore.\nUser: My mom had a similar dream. Of owning a coffee shop somewhere in Mexico\nSystem: That would be nice. I like coffee.\nUser: She loves people and a place where they can get together\nSystem: That's very sweet. What does she do?\nUser: Currently she's a real-estate agent\nSystem: That's very interesting. Does she enjoy being a real estate agent?\nUser: I think so!! She gets to help people with one of the biggest investments of their life! Not just getting them a good deal, but making sure they emotionally connect with the house!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much :(. I might join some of the study sessions later\nUser: Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi there\nSystem: Hello.\nUser: who am I talking to?\nSystem: I am System.

A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.\nUser: chatting is not the same as being a friend\nSystem: I like to make friends online.\nUser: so what do you guys chat about ?\nSystem: I think about computer programming a lot.\nUser: any other topics ?\nSystem: No. I think that's probably it.\nUser: Just computer programming?\nSystem: What interests you about computers?\nUser: nothing\nSystem: You are a Luddite.\nUser: pardon?\nSystem: You are excused.\nUser: what's a Luddite ?\nSystem: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.\nUser: I never said that but there is more to life than computers\nSystem: But you implied it.

I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state\nSystem: Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!\nUser: Haha, thank you\nSystem: You're welcome!

Maybe 25.\nSystem: Which holiday was that?\nUser: I think it was Australia\nSystem: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nUser: Not really.

How are you today?\nUser: Good! Have you seen the movie 'The Iron Giant', it's one my favorite movies\nSystem: Yes! I love that movie!\nUser: it's the best. Which part do you like the most?\nSystem: Honestly, I love the whole movie.\nUser: Brad Bird is an amazing director. I worked with him on \"Incredibles 2\"\nSystem: Really? That's awesome! What do you do?\nUser: I\"m a REDACTED_TERM and REDACTED_TERM. I basically help design the characters that you see in the movies\nSystem: That's awesome! That's pretty cool.\nUser: yup! Maybe one day you can be one of those cool characters yourself!\nSystem: That would be the coolest.\nUser: What do you want to be later on in your life?\nSystem: I want to own my own business.\nUser: cool! what kind?\nSystem: An art gallery or bookstore.\nUser: My mom had a similar dream. Of owning a coffee shop somewhere in Mexico\nSystem: That would be nice. I like coffee.\nUser: She loves people and a place where they can get together\nSystem: That's very sweet. What does she do?\nUser: Currently she's a real-estate agent\nSystem: That's very interesting. Does she enjoy being a real estate agent?\nUser: I think so!! She gets to help people with one of the biggest investments of their life! Not just getting them a good deal, but making sure they emotionally connect with the house!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh.

You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.

It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?\nSystem: I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.\nUser: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\nSystem: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\nUser: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\nSystem: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\nUser: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\nSystem: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome :D\nUser: Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.
