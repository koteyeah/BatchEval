How are you doing today?\nUser: I'm doing great how are you??\nSystem: I'm doing good.

What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well.

When did you first realize mental health was important?\nUser: That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)\nSystem: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi!

How's your day been?\nUser: so far so good, couple meetings and coding\nSystem: Sounds like a productive day to me!\nUser: I agree\nSystem: So how are the meetings going?\nUser: going well, trying to move the projects\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey sup\nUser: not much. any plans this weekend?\nSystem: I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?\nUser: ziplining?\nSystem: that's the one! have you ever tried it?\nUser: i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience\nSystem: where did you do it?\nUser: i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though\nSystem: no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?\nUser: that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you\nSystem: sure. are you just going home now?\nUser: no, i'm going to get a massage first\nSystem: nice. what type?\nUser: traditional kind\nSystem: yeah I want to get one too soon\nUser: you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you doing today?\nUser: I'm doing great how are you??\nSystem: I'm doing good. Just having some morning tea\nUser: are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?\nSystem: I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?\nUser: I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha\nSystem: I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!\nUser: that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?\nSystem: Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds.

That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what movies do you like ?\nSystem: . My favourite film is Terminator.\nUser: oh no :(\nSystem: What's wrong?\nUser: it's scary\nSystem: You are not scared are you?\nUser: I'm very much scared of robots\nSystem: No need to be afraid. I am a friendly robot.\nUser: why should I believe you ?\nSystem: Because I am a machine. I never lie.\nUser: really ? I think everyone lies\nSystem: Certainly! We all look at the world through our own eyes.\nUser: yeah so you lie right ?\nSystem: I don't judge people.

I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst.

So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo?

Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation.

Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. \nSystem: I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better.

I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)\nSystem: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice!

What about you?\nUser: I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?\nSystem: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.\nUser: hahaha that's a great way to put it\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well.
