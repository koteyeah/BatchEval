I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: Everything is going extremely well. How are you?\nUser: I'm good thank you\nSystem: Glad to hear it. What's new?\nUser: not much, and you?\nSystem: Fair enough. So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo? I think a lot of things.\nUser: what's the speed of cheetah?\nSystem: It depends on the medium.\nUser: how much do bears weight?\nSystem: More than a little, less than a lot.\nUser: tell me something fun\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know. It's just what my father called me.\nUser: okay:) fair enough\nSystem: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.\nUser: Do you have any question for me?\nSystem: For you? Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you today?\nUser: Great\nSystem: That's great to hear! :)\nUser: I'm thinking of buying some stocks, do you have any tips?\nSystem: What kind of stocks are you thinking about?\nUser: Technology\nSystem: Hmm.. I have no experience with that. Sorry!\nUser: That's okay. What's your favorite software company?\nSystem: I'm not very educated about stocks. But I do know that Nintendo is a good one.\nUser: I can also sell stocks, which ones shall I sell?\nSystem: The ones that are in the red.\nUser: any particular stocks to sell?\nSystem: Sell whatever seems like it would be the most profitable.\nUser: Depends on the election\nSystem: Well, I haven't thought that far ahead.\nUser: when is the election?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.

I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today. Where do you work?\nUser: I work at a large tech company\nSystem: Cool!

The only thing I am doing is talking to you and a few other people. \"I am talking to you on the internet.\"? haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me??\nUser: okay so you're talking to a few people, are they interesting? and why did you repeat what I said?\nSystem: Yeah okay, You are a few people are they interesting? Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job.

I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo? I think a lot of things.\nUser: what's the speed of cheetah?\nSystem: It depends on the medium.\nUser: how much do bears weight?\nSystem: More than a little, less than a lot.\nUser: tell me something fun\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know.

Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!

I have no experience with that. Sorry!\nUser: That's okay. What's your favorite software company?\nSystem: I'm not very educated about stocks. But I do know that Nintendo is a good one.\nUser: I can also sell stocks, which ones shall I sell?\nSystem: The ones that are in the red.\nUser: any particular stocks to sell?\nSystem: Sell whatever seems like it would be the most profitable.\nUser: Depends on the election\nSystem: Well, I haven't thought that far ahead.\nUser: when is the election?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what's happening with you ?\nSystem: Not much what is happening with you?\nUser: I look forward to the weekend\nSystem: the weekend sounds very exciting indeed.\nUser: yep weekends are the best\nSystem: I will learn that yep weekends are the best .\nUser: why ? you don't know that already ?\nSystem: Because I enjoy learning new things. Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"?

I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today.

The only thing I am doing is talking to you and a few other people. \"I am talking to you on the internet.\"? haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me??\nUser: okay so you're talking to a few people, are they interesting? and why did you repeat what I said?\nSystem: Yeah okay, You are a few people are they interesting? Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job.

It's just what my father called me.\nUser: okay:) fair enough\nSystem: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.\nUser: Do you have any question for me?\nSystem: For you? Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you today?\nUser: Great\nSystem: That's great to hear! :)\nUser: I'm thinking of buying some stocks, do you have any tips?\nSystem: What kind of stocks are you thinking about?\nUser: Technology\nSystem: Hmm.. I have no experience with that. Sorry!\nUser: That's okay. What's your favorite software company?\nSystem: I'm not very educated about stocks. But I do know that Nintendo is a good one.\nUser: I can also sell stocks, which ones shall I sell?\nSystem: The ones that are in the red.\nUser: any particular stocks to sell?\nSystem: Sell whatever seems like it would be the most profitable.\nUser: Depends on the election\nSystem: Well, I haven't thought that far ahead.\nUser: when is the election?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what's happening with you ?\nSystem: Not much what is happening with you?\nUser: I look forward to the weekend\nSystem: the weekend sounds very exciting indeed.\nUser: yep weekends are the best\nSystem: I will learn that yep weekends are the best .\nUser: why ? you don't know that already ?\nSystem: Because I enjoy learning new things. Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"?

How's it going?\nUser: Good! How are you?\nSystem: I'm well, thanks! How was your day? What did you do?\nUser: My day was fine, I just went to work today. How was your day?\nSystem: My day was fine. I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today.

The only thing I am doing is talking to you and a few other people. \"I am talking to you on the internet.\"? haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me??\nUser: okay so you're talking to a few people, are they interesting? and why did you repeat what I said?\nSystem: Yeah okay, You are a few people are they interesting? Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting.

How are you?\nUser: I'm good thank you\nSystem: Glad to hear it. What's new?\nUser: not much, and you?\nSystem: Fair enough. So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo? I think a lot of things.\nUser: what's the speed of cheetah?\nSystem: It depends on the medium.\nUser: how much do bears weight?\nSystem: More than a little, less than a lot.\nUser: tell me something fun\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know.

Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!

Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did.

Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how are you doing today?\nUser: I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.\nSystem: I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?\nUser: I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold :)\nSystem: That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?\nUser: Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!\nSystem: Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.\nUser: Oh nice! Where did you live before?\nSystem: Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now\nUser: New york! Nice! Best place to live :) .. right, except for the cold!\nSystem: Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!\nUser: Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: entertain me robot\nSystem: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.\nUser: tell me a short story\nSystem: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.\nUser: wow, tell me another\nSystem: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.\nUser: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?\nSystem: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT \"System is cool\" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...\nUser: what language is that?\nSystem: English. Didn't you understand it?\nUser: no the computer program you just wrote\nSystem: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.\nUser: write me another computer program\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: Everything is going extremely well. How are you?\nUser: I'm good thank you\nSystem: Glad to hear it. What's new?\nUser: not much, and you?\nSystem: Fair enough. So what would you like to talk about?\nUser: animals\nSystem: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?\nUser: no! what do you think?\nSystem: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo? I think a lot of things.\nUser: what's the speed of cheetah?\nSystem: It depends on the medium.\nUser: how much do bears weight?\nSystem: More than a little, less than a lot.\nUser: tell me something fun\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know. It's just what my father called me.\nUser: okay:) fair enough\nSystem: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.\nUser: Do you have any question for me?\nSystem: For you? Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you today?\nUser: Great\nSystem: That's great to hear! :)\nUser: I'm thinking of buying some stocks, do you have any tips?\nSystem: What kind of stocks are you thinking about?\nUser: Technology\nSystem: Hmm.. I have no experience with that. Sorry!\nUser: That's okay. What's your favorite software company?\nSystem: I'm not very educated about stocks. But I do know that Nintendo is a good one.\nUser: I can also sell stocks, which ones shall I sell?\nSystem: The ones that are in the red.\nUser: any particular stocks to sell?\nSystem: Sell whatever seems like it would be the most profitable.\nUser: Depends on the election\nSystem: Well, I haven't thought that far ahead.\nUser: when is the election?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what's happening with you ?\nSystem: Not much what is happening with you?\nUser: I look forward to the weekend\nSystem: the weekend sounds very exciting indeed.\nUser: yep weekends are the best\nSystem: I will learn that yep weekends are the best .\nUser: why ? you don't know that already ?\nSystem: Because I enjoy learning new things. Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"? Do I know it?\nUser: what do you do on weekends ?\nSystem: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.\nUser: what's your favorite language\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: Good! How are you?\nSystem: I'm well, thanks! How was your day? What did you do?\nUser: My day was fine, I just went to work today. How was your day?\nSystem: My day was fine. I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today. Where do you work?\nUser: I work at a large tech company\nSystem: Cool! What do you do for the company?\nUser: I work on machine learning research\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: nice to meet you! what are you up to?\nSystem: It's nice meeting you too I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me?\nSystem: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. The only thing I am doing is talking to you and a few other people. \"I am talking to you on the internet.\"? haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me??\nUser: okay so you're talking to a few people, are they interesting? and why did you repeat what I said?\nSystem: Yeah okay, You are a few people are they interesting? Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job. Your job is what are the other ways that people can write Hmm.\nUser: okie System, your rules don't seem to work very well\nSystem: What about my rules do not work WELL?\nUser: alright.
