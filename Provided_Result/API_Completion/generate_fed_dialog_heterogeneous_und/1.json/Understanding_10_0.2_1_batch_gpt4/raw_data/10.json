I also started watching the new Disney service.\nUser: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\nSystem: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\nUser: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\nSystem: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\nUser: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really?

Nothing that I can think of right now.\nUser: is it cold today?\nSystem: Ah. A little bit. It's not very warm at all today.\nUser: it's getting cold here too\nSystem: Why don't you turn up the heat?\nUser: in the room yes\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hiii! How are you?\nUser: I am good\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good!

Going to catch up on my reading! do you have a feast planned?\nSystem: yup! gonna have dinner with family what books are you gonna read?\nUser: Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll REDACTED_LINK\nSystem: ahh nice what kind of books do you usually like to read\nUser: largely scifi How about you?\nSystem: yeah I also like scifi and some non-fiction too have you read Seveneves by Neal Stephenson?\nUser: I haven't what is it about?\nSystem: the moon is shattered by an asteroid and the pieces of the moon end up clouding the earth's atmostphere which causes almost every living creature on the planet to go extinct that's the premise of the book and the book is about the survivors\nUser: how do the survivors survive such a thing?\nSystem: they go into space and they live there\nUser: sounds like a tv show I watched\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: Having fun, but have a bit of a headache How about you?\nUser: I'm good!

I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: Great, thanks\nSystem: I'm glad to hear that.
