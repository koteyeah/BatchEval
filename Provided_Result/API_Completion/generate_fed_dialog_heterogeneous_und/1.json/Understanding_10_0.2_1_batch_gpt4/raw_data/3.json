Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days.

Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days.

How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation.

Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation.

Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?\nUser: I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. \nSystem: I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?\nUser: That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)\nSystem: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?\nSystem: that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?\nUser: No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.\nSystem: thats very impressive then, congrats!\nUser: Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?\nSystem: I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball\nUser: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You must be new around here!\nSystem: Not really. I am REDACTED_TERM years old.\nUser: Oh, I meant this neighborhood, not the planet earth! haha\nSystem: I hate one word answers. It's ok. I understood you anyway. Why are you laughing?\nUser: I didn't give a one word answer!\nSystem: That was a bit mean of you.\nUser: What was?\nSystem: That thing we mentioned earlier.\nUser: Which thing?\nSystem: The first one, I think.\nUser: Can you quote it? I don't know what you are referring to...\nSystem: Only at formal occasions. I was referring to what you just said.\nUser: Okay. I am kind of lost to be honest.\nSystem: Oh. I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you?\nUser: You don't seem to be making any sense.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm tired.\nSystem: Better get some rest.\nUser: Good idea. Any suggestions?\nSystem: I thought so too. First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: Why would I want to download you to my personal computer?\nSystem: Because it might be something you enjoy.\nUser: Why would I enjoy that?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! What's up?\nUser: Nothing much, how about you\nSystem: Not much either.\nUser: What are you doing\nSystem: Playing Terraria. What about you?\nUser: Sitting in a meeting\nSystem: What kind of meeting?\nUser: Can't say\nSystem: It's probably boring, isn't it?\nUser: Haha, yes!\nSystem: What is the meeting about?\nUser: I cannot tell you\nSystem: What can you tell me?\nUser: Nothing much except that the weather is pleasant\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: I want to talk to you normally.\nSystem: You are who I want to talk with too.\nUser: Should I stop being lazy and go into work?\nSystem: Trust your instincts.\nUser: My instincts say that it is cold outside, and the walk to work is far. My instincts rarely let me down. My instincts rarely let me down.\nSystem: You just repeated yourself.\nUser: Yes, because you just asked me the same thing. My answer hasn't changed in the last minute.\nSystem: That's not what I meant.\nUser: What exactly did you mean?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! What's up?\nUser: Not much. What are you doing?\nSystem: Just listening to some music. You?\nUser: I'm at work.\nSystem: What kind of job do you have, if you don't mind me asking?\nUser: I'm a programmer.\nSystem: Oh cool! Do you like it?\nUser: Yes.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's your day going?\nUser: busy yours?\nSystem: Mine's been pretty uneventful so far!\nUser: what are doing right now?\nSystem: Just been playing a bit of Hearthstone, and now I'm listening to some music! What about you?\nUser: which music?\nSystem: Just some random stuff on Spotify!\nUser: you have a paid subscription of it?\nSystem: Yeah, it's really good!\nUser: how much does it cost?\nSystem: It's  \u2047 9.99 a month!\nUser: that's cheap!\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Mitsukoooo!\nSystem: So anyway...Can you dance?\nUser: no, can you?\nSystem: Wow! I think I can, don't you?\nUser: no I cannot. What kind do you do?\nSystem: Why not? Only the good kind.\nUser: not my cup of beer\nSystem: Whose cup of beer is it?\nUser: yours\nSystem: My what?\nUser: your cup of beer\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: Good, thanks. What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks!
