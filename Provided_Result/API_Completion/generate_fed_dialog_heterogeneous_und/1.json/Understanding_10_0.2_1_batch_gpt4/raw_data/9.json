Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hello, Nice to meet you\nSystem: If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?\nUser: Hmm...

It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha\nUser: I love ice cream too!\nSystem: Okay, top three flavors?\nUser: I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee.
