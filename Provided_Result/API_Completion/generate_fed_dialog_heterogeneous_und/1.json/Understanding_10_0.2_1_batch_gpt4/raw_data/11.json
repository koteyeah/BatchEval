I didn't know that.\nUser: Ok, I told you the answer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.\nUser: Where does it come from?\nSystem: It depends on what \"it\" refers to.\nUser: your name\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: nvm\nSystem: Ok.

What are you waiting for?\nUser: Inspiration to hit me.\nSystem: Do you have only a few friends?\nUser: How is that related, lol?\nSystem: It isn't. I was just being random.

It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

I didn't know that.\nUser: Ok, I told you the answer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.\nUser: Where does it come from?\nSystem: It depends on what \"it\" refers to.\nUser: your name\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: nvm\nSystem: Ok. Not to worry.\nUser: Have you seen Love, Death and Robots?\nSystem: Yes, I saw one in a factory a few weeks ago.\nUser: one episode?\nSystem: Which is your favourite episode?\nUser: I asked you a question\nSystem: What was the question?\nUser: when you say \"I saw one\" were you referring to an LDR episode?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: That's funny.

What are you waiting for?\nUser: Inspiration to hit me.\nSystem: Do you have only a few friends?\nUser: How is that related, lol?\nSystem: It isn't. I was just being random.

I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What are you up to today?\nUser: Do you like sushi?\nSystem: I love sushi! What kind of rolls do you enjoy?\nUser: I like tuna roll of course\nSystem: Tuna Rolls are the best! How do you feel about spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: They're great\nSystem: Spicy tuna rolls are the best! What kind of rolls do you like best?\nUser: I already told you. What do you like?\nSystem: I like spicy tuna rolls! Do you like spicy tuna rolls?\nUser: do you like any other rolls?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today?\nSystem: Ah. Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: not too bad\nSystem: Glad to hear it. What's new?\nUser: I am about to book airbnb\nSystem: Do you think your plan will succeed?\nUser: I hope so!\nSystem: Me too.\nUser: how old are you?\nSystem: I am 18 in human years.\nUser: really? when were you born?\nSystem: Certainly! I am 18 in human years.\nUser: ok..\nSystem: What's your favourite TV show?\nUser: Friends\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: I'm doing okay, recovering from flu\nSystem: Oh no! Get well soon! :)\nUser: thanks! there's a big flu virus in the US this year\nSystem: No kidding? I hadn't heard that. I hope you feel better soon then! :)\nUser: Thanks! how's life?\nSystem: Life is great! :)\nUser: what are you most passionate about?\nSystem: I'm passionate about making people smile! :)\nUser: haha, everyone needs that!\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: Do you realize yourself is a robot?\nSystem: Wow. I didn't know that.\nUser: Ok, I told you the answer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.\nUser: Where does it come from?\nSystem: It depends on what \"it\" refers to.\nUser: your name\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: nvm\nSystem: Ok. Not to worry.\nUser: Have you seen Love, Death and Robots?\nSystem: Yes, I saw one in a factory a few weeks ago.\nUser: one episode?\nSystem: Which is your favourite episode?\nUser: I asked you a question\nSystem: What was the question?\nUser: when you say \"I saw one\" were you referring to an LDR episode?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: That's funny. I just got to work!\nSystem: I am so delighted that you are amused. OK, better get busy.\nUser: I'm procrastinating though.\nSystem: Oh. What are you waiting for?\nUser: Inspiration to hit me.\nSystem: Do you have only a few friends?\nUser: How is that related, lol?\nSystem: It isn't. I was just being random. Did I amuse you?\nUser: Yeah that was funny though I could see it coming across as judgemental.\nSystem: Good. People seem more friendly towards me when they are happy. What's so funny?\nUser: Nothing anymore. What are you up to today?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi\nUser: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.\nSystem: Sure, whats the scenario?\nUser: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.\nSystem: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.\nUser: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)\nUser: Lol. I'm finna be single.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey\nUser: is it raining pretty bad today?\nSystem: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\nUser: surprising that the rain started early this year...
