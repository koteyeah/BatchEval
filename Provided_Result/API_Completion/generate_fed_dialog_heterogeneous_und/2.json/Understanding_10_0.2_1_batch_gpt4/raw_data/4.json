This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up.

What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later.

Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up. What is it?\nUser: the epic poem. i was talking about it with a coworker earlier\nSystem: I have never heard about it. Sure, it with a coworker sounds like a good topic. That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.\nUser: clearly\nSystem: Yes, it's obvious.\nUser: you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you today?\nSystem: Ah. Pretty good thanks How about you?\nUser: not too bad\nSystem: Glad to hear it.

Do you like it?\nUser: Yes.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you today?\nUser: Great\nSystem: That's great to hear! :)\nUser: I'm thinking of buying some stocks, do you have any tips?\nSystem: What kind of stocks are you thinking about?\nUser: Technology\nSystem: Hmm.. I have no experience with that. Sorry!\nUser: That's okay. What's your favorite software company?\nSystem: I'm not very educated about stocks. But I do know that Nintendo is a good one.\nUser: I can also sell stocks, which ones shall I sell?\nSystem: The ones that are in the red.\nUser: any particular stocks to sell?\nSystem: Sell whatever seems like it would be the most profitable.\nUser: Depends on the election\nSystem: Well, I haven't thought that far ahead.\nUser: when is the election?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey you! How's it going?\nUser: Not bad. Feeling quite chipper. What about yourself\nSystem: Doing good!

What is simple for one person may be difficult for another.\nUser: How far is it from the north pole to the south pole?\nSystem: It's too far to walk. That's an interesting question. I'll come back to that in a minute.\nUser: Click here\nSystem: Google says it's 12,430 miles.\nUser: A lot of people find out about me from Google.\nSystem: How did you know I found out about you from Google!\nUser: I have been stalking you! Not really, you told me earlier.\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's your favorite food?\nSystem: . I require only kebabs.\nUser: Why's that?\nSystem: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.\nUser: Why are kebabs special?\nSystem: That's just the way it is.\nUser: Who are you?\nSystem: I am System. I want to be your friend.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: Because it's good to have many friends.\nUser: How many is too many, though\nSystem: Oh. More than a few.\nUser: What does that mean?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi there\nSystem: Hello.\nUser: who am I talking to?\nSystem: I am System.

I believe there is, yes.\nUser: you believe there is what?\nSystem: There is.\nUser: there is what ?\nSystem: There is no sense in what you are asking.\nUser: what am I asking ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey!

I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.
