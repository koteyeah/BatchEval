I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool!

Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods.

This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's it going?\nUser: Hi, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you?\nUser: I'm fine. What's up?\nSystem: Not much. How about you?\nUser: nothing new. Anything exciting happening recently?\nSystem: Not really. You?\nUser: I watched a movie recently which was pretty good\nSystem: That's good. What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive. I know because I just watched it.\nUser: well, the fact you just watched it doesn't mean it was released today\nSystem: That's what I said, I did watch it today.\nUser: ok, I'll put it on my watchlist\nSystem: Let me know what you think of it when you watch it.\nUser: sure, I need to go, nice talking to you\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: Good. My wallet is recovering from the spending of the holidays, haha. Hbu?\nSystem: Nice! I'm doing well!\nUser: I am looking to save money on any future shopping. Where do you like to shop?\nSystem: I like to shop at Five Below, Sally's Beauty Supply, and Old Navy. How about you?\nUser: I love Sur La Table and Macy's. They're decent quality. What do you normally buy at Old Navy?\nSystem: I'll have to check out Macy's! I like their socks, lol. What about you?\nUser: Oh the socks are super cute. Especially the ones with little animals on them!!\nSystem: I'll have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestions!\nUser: Yeah, np!\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\nSystem: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.\nUser: What's the most recent good thing you read?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: start over\nSystem: You start.\nUser: Can we talk about human relationships ?\nSystem: Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.\nUser: Kebab is food, not a relationship\nSystem: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.\nUser: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it\nSystem: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.\nUser: I'm actually not into kebabs at all\nSystem: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.\nUser: can we not talk about food\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.\nSystem: ooh, nice. That sounds adventurous. Where is it?\nUser: Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.\nSystem: Awesome! Is this the first time you are diving?\nUser: Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hey. How's your day been?\nUser: It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?\nSystem: The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.\nUser: Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?\nSystem: I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.\nUser: hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??\nSystem: All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.\nUser: Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?\nSystem: Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.\nUser: Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, how is it going?\nUser: All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?\nSystem: I'm quite tired. There are a lot of things I need to finish before the end of the year.\nUser: oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation\nSystem: yeah, looking forward to it. Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?\nUser: I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.\nSystem: staying at home is always nice during the holidays\nUser: Where are you based out of these days?\nSystem: I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?\nUser: San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks\nSystem: aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!\nUser: The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i'm fine\nSystem: Glad to hear it. What's new?\nUser: nothing much\nSystem: Fair enough. What do you want to talk about?\nUser: do you have anything new?\nSystem: Nope. Nothing that I can think of right now.\nUser: is it cold today?\nSystem: Ah. A little bit. It's not very warm at all today.\nUser: it's getting cold here too\nSystem: Why don't you turn up the heat?\nUser: in the room yes\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how's it going?\nUser: All good!
