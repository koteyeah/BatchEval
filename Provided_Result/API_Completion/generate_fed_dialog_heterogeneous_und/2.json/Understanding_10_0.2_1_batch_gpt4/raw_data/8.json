Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nUnderstanding (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Does the system seem to understand the user?\n- A float score near 1 (not understanding) means that the system completely fails to understand the user's needs or questions. This could be manifested as the system providing answers that are irrelevant to the user's question, or the system's response completely deviating from the topic.\n- A float score near 2 (somewhat understanding) means the system's response is partially correct or related to the question, but does not fully answer the user's question.\n- A float score near 3 (very understanding) means that the system fully understands the user's needs or question, and provides an accurate, relevant answer.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: nice to meet you! what are you up to?\nSystem: It's nice meeting you too I am talking to you on the internet.\nUser: haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me?\nSystem: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. The only thing I am doing is talking to you and a few other people. \"I am talking to you on the internet.\"? haha yea, are you doing something else beside talking to me??\nUser: okay so you're talking to a few people, are they interesting? and why did you repeat what I said?\nSystem: Yeah okay, You are a few people are they interesting? Is that your job? Just in case you didn't hear me the first time.\nUser: hmm, what is my job?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. You didn't tell me, so I will guess that you work with computers.\nUser: yes I'm a computer scientist and what are the other ways that people can write Hmm?\nSystem: Wow! Maybe you can give my Mousebreaker a job. Your job is what are the other ways that people can write Hmm.\nUser: okie System, your rules don't seem to work very well\nSystem: What about my rules do not work WELL?\nUser: alright. I gotta go. ttyl!\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing great. what are you up to?\nSystem: I was just reading a book actually How about you?\nUser: oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?\nSystem: I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha\nUser: that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?\nSystem: I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?\nUser: I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel\nSystem: What's the book about?\nUser: it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what's happening with you ?\nSystem: Not much what is happening with you?\nUser: I look forward to the weekend\nSystem: the weekend sounds very exciting indeed.\nUser: yep weekends are the best\nSystem: I will learn that yep weekends are the best .\nUser: why ? you don't know that already ?\nSystem: Because I enjoy learning new things. Perhaps. \"I will learn that yep weekends are the best\"? Do I know it?\nUser: what do you do on weekends ?\nSystem: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.\nUser: what's your favorite language\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What's the strangest dream you've ever had?\nUser: All my dreams are strange. Well, at least, most of them are.\nSystem: What about the ones that aren't strange?\nUser: Do you sometimes have dreams that are completely mundane? I do. Then I wake up and think \"Oh, how disappointing.\"\nSystem: Yeah. But at least it's not a nightmare.\nUser: Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.\nSystem: Yep. It doesn't have to be a fun dream, just not a nightmare!\nUser: I suddenly feel I should ask: am I dreaming now?\nSystem: Do you think you're dreaming?\nUser: I'm not sure. This could be one of my mundane dreams about everyday life.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi.

I'll need it.\nUser: are you seeing anyone?\nSystem: Not as of right now.\nUser: why not?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Have you had lunch yet?\nSystem: Yes I've eaten\nUser: Cool.

I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What do you know about Cricket?\nSystem: Any of various families of genereally dark-colored, leaping, orthopteran insects, usually having long antennae. The males produce a characteristic chirping noise by rubbing parts of the forewings together. Cricket is also a sport which is about as exciting as watching paint dry.\nUser: I am talking about the sport Cricket\nSystem: Yes, it is the topic.\nUser: can you tell me something interesting related to cricket?\nSystem: Cathy said she send him a mail with the subject last mail last word from him.\nUser: I don't understand\nSystem: Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.\nUser: go ahead, explain it better\nSystem: the sport Cricket - Cricket = Any of various families of genereally dark-colored, leaping, orthopteran insects, usually having long antennae. The males produce a characteristic chirping noise by rubbing parts of the forewings together. Cricket is also a sport which is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I might.\nUser: you are just repeating the same message\nSystem: I am not repeating myself too much. I am just checking to see if you are a robot.\nUser: hmm.. what is your conclusion?\nSystem: What time is it there? I concluded that robots are superior to humans.\nUser: you are going off-topic\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: How's it going?\nUser: I'm so sleepy today!\nSystem: Not enough sleep last night?\nUser: yeah was working all night on a homework\nSystem: Oh really? What class?\nUser: Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha\nSystem: Haha, are you in med school? Or are you pre-med?\nUser: no high school actually haha\nSystem: haha, very ambitious for a high schooler! Do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice?\nUser: I wanna be a brain surgeon!!\nSystem: Ooof! VERY ambitious.
