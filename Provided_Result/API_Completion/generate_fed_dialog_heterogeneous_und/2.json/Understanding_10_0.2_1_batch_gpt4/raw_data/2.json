I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases.
