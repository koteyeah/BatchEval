Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience.

I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe! How long was the stay?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: Good! How are you?\nSystem: I'm well, thanks! How was your day?

I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today.

But I do have an answer to every question..\nUser: do you have suggestion for the thanksgiving holidays?\nSystem: Where would I get it? But I do have an answer to every question..\nUser: do you know thanksgiving?\nSystem: I know very little about it. What kind of it do you like?\nUser: do you like turkey?\nSystem: Yes but it can be a bit dry. I only really eat it at Christmas.\nUser: eat turkey at Christmas not Thanksgiving?\nSystem: What does it taste like?\nUser: tastes like chicken\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?\nUser: not really, I'm excited today\nSystem: Ah. Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm trying to figure out what to make for this weekend's party.

What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise.

Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true.

I only really eat it at Christmas.\nUser: eat turkey at Christmas not Thanksgiving?\nSystem: What does it taste like?\nUser: tastes like chicken\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?\nUser: not really, I'm excited today\nSystem: Ah. Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I'm trying to figure out what to make for this weekend's party. Any suggestions?\nSystem: Don't think too hard. I'm sure I can smell sawdust. First you must download me to your personal computer.\nUser: I must do what the what now?\nSystem: Right now?Why do you have to do it?\nUser: Hey, your spacing is off.\nSystem: You've got my full attention. off was not my intention.\nUser: And your capitalization!\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! What's up???\nUser: Nothing much, how you doin?\nSystem: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\nUser: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\nSystem: The last time in New York, back in June.\nUser: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\nSystem: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\nUser: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\nSystem: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\nUser: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\nSystem: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\nUser: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What are you up to today?\nUser: Do you like sushi?\nSystem: I love sushi!
