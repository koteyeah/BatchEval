How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know.

It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.

What trails did you ski on?\nUser: I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha\nSystem: a resort in Montreal\nUser: Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it\nSystem: Yeah I grew up speaking it. It's pretty much mandatory here\nUser: Did you go anywhere else in montreal?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey sup\nUser: not much. any plans this weekend?\nSystem: I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?\nUser: ziplining?\nSystem: that's the one! have you ever tried it?\nUser: i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience\nSystem: where did you do it?\nUser: i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though\nSystem: no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?\nUser: that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you\nSystem: sure. are you just going home now?\nUser: no, i'm going to get a massage first\nSystem: nice. what type?\nUser: traditional kind\nSystem: yeah I want to get one too soon\nUser: you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, what's up?\nUser: Just chillin'. how are you?\nSystem: I'm pretty good, thanks.\nUser: Do anything interesting today?\nSystem: I went to the local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. What about you?\nUser: Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!\nSystem: Oh my gosh. What was it like??\nUser: It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\nUser: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\nSystem: Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?\nUser: Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!

It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?\nSystem: I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.\nUser: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\nSystem: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\nUser: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\nSystem: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\nUser: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\nSystem: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\nUser: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\nSystem: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome :D\nUser: Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.\nUser: i have sore throats\nSystem: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello there!\nUser: How's your day going?\nSystem: I've seen better days, how about you?\nUser: I'm good I'm good.
