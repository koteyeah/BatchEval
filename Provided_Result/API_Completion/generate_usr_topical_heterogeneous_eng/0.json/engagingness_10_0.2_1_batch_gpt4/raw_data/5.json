such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it is a nice place . i hope you have a good day .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do

tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see

such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he made a lot of money but now he 's in the nba half of fame . it 's funny because he lived in his sister 's shadow all throughout high school . when he tried braggign about scoring 40 points in a game , he found out she had scored 105 points and broken 8 national records the same day !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide

too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he made a lot of money but now he 's in the nba half of fame . it 's funny because he lived in his sister 's shadow all throughout high school . when he tried

B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide

too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he made a lot of money but now he 's in the nba half of fame . it 's funny because he lived in his sister 's shadow all throughout high school . when he tried

like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow people in the 60 's must have really loved bowling ! even today , a lot of niche activities have a dedicated fanbase . there are people that fantasy draft the national spelling bee ! \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do

such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you

such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out

and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it is a nice place . i hope you have a good day .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do

tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game

such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he made a lot of money but now he 's in the nba half of fame . it 's funny because he lived in his sister 's shadow all throughout high school . when he tried braggign about scoring 40 points in a game , he found out she had scored 105 points and broken 8 national records the same day !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of

but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide

.\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if they have a different name like the president of indonesia 's book .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it is a nice place . i hope you have a good day .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the patriot and tom is amazing . do you have one ?\nSpeaker B: the guys is awesome and now also a book author . did you hear about that ?\nSpeaker A: oh yeah i heard he wrote that book the tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he made a lot of money but now he 's in the nba half of fame . it 's funny because he lived in his sister 's shadow all throughout high school . when he tried braggign about scoring 40 points in a game , he found out she had scored 105 points and broken 8 national records the same day !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide
