what is your favorite nfl team ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think they are more about the third quarter back , it 's like a mini super bowl bowl for a reason\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the patriot and tom is amazing . do you have one ?\nSpeaker B: the guys is awesome and now also a book author . did you hear about that ?\nSpeaker A: oh yeah i heard he wrote that book the tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: maybe they 'll use it to identify the best players ! benjarvus green - ellis has never fumbled the ball throughout his entire career !\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know . i would like to know what the new employees are called .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: did you know that she had to walk backward to avoid having her photo taken \n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
