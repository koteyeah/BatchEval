reggie miller , nba hall of famer , could n't escape his older sister cheryl 's shadow while in high school . on january 26 , 1982 , he scored a career high 40 points . he tried bragging about it on the car ride home , only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records !\nSpeaker B: yes , and do you like basketball ?\nSpeaker A: i do nt keep track of all basketball but i do watch the warriors play . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles lakers .\nSpeaker A: james naismith , the inventor of basketball , is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history\nSpeaker B: james naismith wrote and developed the game 's original thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's a lot of soup . are you talking about the fort - reno concert ? i heard flasher will perform there \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,\nSpeaker A: what do you mean by sensible loss ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no kidding , i wonder if there is a huge bail out that land\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

reggie miller , nba hall of famer , could n't escape his older sister cheryl 's shadow while in high school . on january 26 , 1982 , he scored a career high 40 points . he tried bragging about it on the car ride home , only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records !\nSpeaker B: yes , and do you like basketball ?\nSpeaker A: i do nt keep track of all basketball but i do watch the warriors play . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles lakers .\nSpeaker A: james naismith , the inventor of basketball , is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history\nSpeaker B: james naismith wrote and developed the game 's original thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's a lot of soup . are you talking about the fort - reno concert ? i heard flasher will perform there \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,\nSpeaker A: what do you mean by sensible loss ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no kidding , i wonder if there is a huge bail out that land\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

reggie miller , nba hall of famer , could n't escape his older sister cheryl 's shadow while in high school . on january 26 , 1982 , he scored a career high 40 points . he tried bragging about it on the car ride home , only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records !\nSpeaker B: yes , and do you like basketball ?\nSpeaker A: i do nt keep track of all basketball but i do watch the warriors play . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles lakers .\nSpeaker A: james naismith , the inventor of basketball , is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history\nSpeaker B: james naismith wrote and developed the game 's original thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's a lot of soup . are you talking about the fort - reno concert ? i heard flasher will perform there \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,\nSpeaker A: what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team .\nSpeaker B: well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach\nSpeaker A: john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ?\nSpeaker A: football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him .\nSpeaker B: maybe he demanded a high salary ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no kidding , i wonder if there is a huge bail out that land\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i heard flasher will perform there \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so in your opinion there will be more \" homegrown \" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,\nSpeaker A: what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team .\nSpeaker B: well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach\nSpeaker A: john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ?\nSpeaker A: football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him .\nSpeaker B: maybe he demanded a high salary ?

i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no kidding , i wonder if there is a huge bail out that land\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
