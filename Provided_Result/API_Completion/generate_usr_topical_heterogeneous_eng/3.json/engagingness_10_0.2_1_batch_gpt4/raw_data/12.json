History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not

british only got breaststroke before ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lowering the entry barrier is always a good thing . do you like pixar ? i 've heard they have a secret room in their studio that is often visited by celebrities .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us

league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah he has . he 's the highest paid celebrity right now , but judge judy is right on is coattails . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line .

think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i think it was a great show , you should check it out and get it up . have you ever listened

camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lowering the entry barrier is always a good thing . do you like pixar ? i 've heard they have a secret room in their studio that is often visited by celebrities .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah he has . he 's the highest paid celebrity right now , but judge judy is right on is coattails . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this

of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium

got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work .

the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with

exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the

with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk

. do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think it is because it was from the old days of a fire hazard .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not

british only got breaststroke before ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lowering the entry barrier is always a good thing . do you like pixar ? i 've heard they have a secret room in their studio that is often visited by celebrities .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us

when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah he has . he 's the highest paid celebrity right now , but judge judy is right on is coattails . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line .

think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i think it was a great show , you should check it out and get it up . have you ever listened

upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah he has . he 's the highest paid celebrity right now , but judge judy is right on is coattails . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt

of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium

got talent but problems . the year b.i.g . was killed his anthem raced up the charts .\nSpeaker B: yeah . that s crazy when people pass away that they get a boost of recognition for their work .

exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro

and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk

that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a

era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like

true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help .

i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding

of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the

checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have

the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure it 's carefully protected . did you know old cars had a wooden trunk in the back ? that 's why we call it a trunk .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not swim that much but i occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: do you know how the british only got breaststroke before ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lowering the entry barrier is always a good thing . do you like pixar ? i 've heard they have a secret room in their studio that is often visited by celebrities .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah he has . he 's the highest paid celebrity right now , but judge judy is right on is coattails . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line .

think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i think it was a great show , you should check it out and get it up . have you ever listened to ella fitzgerald ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
