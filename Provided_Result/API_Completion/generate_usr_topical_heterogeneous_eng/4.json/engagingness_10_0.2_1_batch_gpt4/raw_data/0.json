i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if he was a fan of his music ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ?

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ?

i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , that was georgia tech vs cumberland . what a dominant victory .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\nSpeaker A: i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?\nSpeaker B: yes it is pink but i a not sure why they chose that color\nSpeaker A: i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them\nSpeaker B: i wonder too . bowling was more popular than football in the 60s\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah that 's very surprising to me . apparently the top bowlers in the 60 's made twice as much as the top football players ! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ?

the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you today ?

i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , that was georgia tech vs cumberland . what a dominant victory .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\nSpeaker A: i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?\nSpeaker B: yes it is pink but i a not sure why they chose that color\nSpeaker A: i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them\nSpeaker B: i wonder too . bowling was more popular than football in the 60s\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah that 's very surprising to me . apparently the top bowlers in the 60 's made twice as much as the top football players ! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if he was a fan of his music ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ?

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ?

haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello ! are you a fan of country music ?\nSpeaker B: hi ! yes , but do you agree that people should refer to country music as also hillbilly music ?\nSpeaker A: lol no . that 's funny . george strait and jeff bezos are cousins . that 's something i never knew before .\nSpeaker B: yeah i agree ! wow , they really are ?
