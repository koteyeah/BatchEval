i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've ever been able to afford one . i do n't have a kindle , but i do n't have a kindle .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i know that the director actually voiced one of the characters , because the production team could n't find anybody better than him !\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess that means we are not the ones that are elected to be honest\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
