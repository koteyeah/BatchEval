to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you know what else are the odds of that ?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much , but i learned recently that the 3 horizontal line menu on websites is called the hamburger button .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their team if needed .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the patriot and tom is amazing . do you have one ?\nSpeaker B: the guys is awesome and now also a book author . did you hear about that ?\nSpeaker A: oh yeah i heard he wrote that book the tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that town in alaska is a cat mayor . in alaska\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how much the players made in the 1960s ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by

government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by

pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be

big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their team if needed .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the

the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that town in alaska is a cat mayor . in alaska\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how much the players made in the 1960s ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in

down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how much the players made in the 1960s ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by

loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins

guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you

good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their team if needed .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the

the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that town in alaska is a cat mayor . in alaska\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B:

team if needed .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the patriot and tom is amazing . do you have one ?\nSpeaker B: the guys is awesome and now also a book author . did you hear about that ?\nSpeaker A: oh yeah i heard he wrote that book the tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that town in alaska is a cat mayor . in alaska\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how much the players made in the 1960s ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by

to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you know what else are the odds of that ?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you

?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B:

fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3

big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their

?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i

hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how much the players made in the 1960s ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by

was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by

to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: you know what else are the odds of that ?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much , but i learned recently that the 3 horizontal line menu on websites is called the hamburger button .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their team if needed .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the patriot and tom is amazing . do you have one ?\nSpeaker B: the guys is awesome and now also a book author . did you hear about that ?\nSpeaker A: oh yeah i heard he wrote that book the tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that town in alaska is a cat mayor . in alaska\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how much the players made in the 1960s ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: but the us government has always owned 86 % of the land in nevada , it has nothing to do with our current government . well , at least our president hasn 't sold it to russia !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by
