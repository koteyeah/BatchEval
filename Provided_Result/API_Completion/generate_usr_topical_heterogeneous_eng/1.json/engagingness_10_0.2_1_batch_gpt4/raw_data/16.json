{"raw_data": [{"context": "facebook and twitter are taking action against an automated babysitter - rating system reported on last week by the washington post , saying the service broke the social networks ' rules on user surveillance and data privacy.predictim , a california - based start - up , analyzes babysitters ' online histories , including on facebook and twitter , and offers ratings of whether they are at risk of drug abuse , bullying or having a & ldquo;bad attitude.&rdquo ; facebook said it dramatically limited predictim&rsquo;s access to users ' information on instagram and facebook a few weeks ago for violating a ban on developers ' use of personal data to evaluate a person for decisions on hiring or eligibility.facebook spokeswoman katy dormer said the company also launched an investigation earlier this week into predictim&rsquo;s extraction , or & ldquo;scraping,&rdquo ; of personal data . that investigation is ongoing and could include further penalties.twitter spokesman nick pacilio said the site conducted its own investigation earlier this week and revoked predictim&rsquo;s access to important site tools & mdash ; known as application programming interfaces , or apis & mdash ; that would allow the start - up to review and analyze babysitters ' tweets on a massive scale . \" we strictly prohibit the use of twitter data and apis for surveillance purposes , including performing background checks,&rdquo ; pacilio said.the crackdown , which was first reported by bbc news , could restrict predictim&rsquo;s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called & ldquo;advanced artificial intelligence&rdquo ; and sell parents the results . the service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter&rsquo;s life.but predictim&rsquo;s executives said tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from facebook , twitter and instagram . predictim chief executive and co - founder sal parsa said he also believed the social media giants ' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use.&ldquo;twitter and facebook are already mining our data .\n", "system_output": "no , i did n't know that . did you ?", "prompt": "You will be given a batch of 10 samples.

is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?
