this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information

military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want

?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation

books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if most of those guys were good at halo . there was a qb in the nfl named brad johnson , and he 's the only one who has thrown a touchdown pass to himself \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess football has changed so much . i wonder if bowling is more popular in the 60 's than football .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think so too . i also have not seen any of the hbo series , have you ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi

.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even

you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if most of those guys were good at halo . there was a qb in the nfl named brad johnson , and he 's the only one who has thrown a touchdown pass to himself \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess football has changed so much . i wonder if bowling is more popular in the 60 's than football .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think so too . i also have not seen any of the hbo series , have you ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi

there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation

would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a

B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse

.\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want

?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito

would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if most of those guys were good at halo . there was a qb in the nfl named brad johnson , and he 's the only one who has thrown a touchdown pass to himself \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess football has changed so much . i wonder if bowling is more popular in the 60 's than football .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think so too . i also have not seen any of the hbo series , have you ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be

with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $

even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi

History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if most of those guys were good at halo . there was a qb in the nfl named brad johnson , and he 's the only one who has thrown a touchdown pass to himself \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess football has changed so much . i wonder if bowling is more popular in the 60 's than football .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think so too . i also have not seen any of the hbo series , have you ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi

haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want

could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on

follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be

during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing

haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation

would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if most of those guys were good at halo . there was a qb in the nfl named brad johnson , and he 's the only one who has thrown a touchdown pass to himself \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess football has changed so much . i wonder if bowling is more popular in the 60 's than football .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think so too . i also have not seen any of the hbo series , have you ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact

great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my

there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing

haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito

would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if most of those guys were good at halo . there was a qb in the nfl named brad johnson , and he 's the only one who has thrown a touchdown pass to himself \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess football has changed so much . i wonder if bowling is more popular in the 60 's than football .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i think so too . i also have not seen any of the hbo series , have you ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi

important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if most of those guys were good at halo . there was a qb in the nfl named brad johnson , and he 's the only one who has thrown a touchdown pass to himself \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess football has changed so much . i wonder if bowling is more popular in the 60 's than football .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to

that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would

. i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost

there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , that is true . well , it was nice chatting with you !\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation

would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on

telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual
