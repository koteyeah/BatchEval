is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ? ca n't get any more quirky than that .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ?

what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: they are all great players . did you know women can also play in the nfl \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: they are all great players . did you know women can also play in the nfl \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ?

however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i guess he does nt like his money but he also made a lot of money by televising the decision .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ?

is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i guess he does nt like his money but he also made a lot of money by televising the decision .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ?

\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello how are you doing ? reggie miller , nba hall of famer , could n't escape his older sister cheryl 's shadow while in high school . on january 26 , 1982 , he scored a career high 40 points . he tried bragging about it on the car ride home , only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records !\nSpeaker B: yes , and do you like basketball ?\nSpeaker A: i do nt keep track of all basketball but i do watch the warriors play . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles lakers .\nSpeaker A: james naismith , the inventor of basketball , is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history\nSpeaker B: james naismith wrote and developed the game 's original thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a great invention , i wonder if they are paid more than the highest paid employees in most states\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is a great coach , he has been the most winningest coach in postseason history\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i guess he does nt like his money but he also made a lot of money by televising the decision .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones .\nSpeaker B: i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool !\nSpeaker A: i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums .\nSpeaker B: that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! !\nSpeaker A: spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ?\nSpeaker B: i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! !\nSpeaker A: yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented .\nSpeaker B: yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !\nSpeaker A: batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat .\nSpeaker B: that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !\nSpeaker A: i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack .\nSpeaker B: it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo !\nSpeaker A: i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .\nSpeaker B: incognito style ! ! and very simple , they just needed a good breakfast with pancakes to say yes\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: so true . nice chatting with you !\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that facebook and twitter work together on some issues ? they are actually competitors .\nSpeaker A: no , i did n't know that . what kind of issues do they work together on ?\nSpeaker B: the baby sitter - rating system broke the social networks ' rules .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess it 's not that easy to do . i think they have a great time with the consumer ratings though .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ? ca n't get any more quirky than that .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: they are all great players . did you know women can also play in the nfl \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
