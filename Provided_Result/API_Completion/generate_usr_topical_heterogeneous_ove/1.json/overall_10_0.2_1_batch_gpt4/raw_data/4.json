that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ?

i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i know right ! did you know that there is a violin made out of stone that is playable ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that is very impressive , i think he was the best qb ever ever\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ?

did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was the pallbearers at billy mays funeral , i think that was a great funeral\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
