( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ?

did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ?

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ?

pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ?

pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a good idea .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i think that is a good idea . i wonder if the government owns the 86 % of the land in nevada .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
