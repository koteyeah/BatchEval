the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ?

that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is a very strange name . i wonder if he ever got a cat named stubbs .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's a lot of soup . are you talking about the fort - reno concert ? i heard flasher will perform there \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ?

the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think belichick is very strategic and he would n't do something if it would n't help his team win . the last time cleveland won a game in the playoffs was when belichick was their coach . shows how lucky teams are to have him .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm a fan , especially during the regular season , usually if it is done . are you a fan of the nfl ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\nSpeaker A: do you believe in aliens ? the un appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials .\nSpeaker B: yes , definitely . that s cool lol at least they are prepared ! do you believe in aliens ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . i feel like there is more life out there . i wonder if they will make contact with earth ?\nSpeaker B: i m assuming so , otherwise what would the ambassador have to study ? lol how else can he be prepared if there s no evidence ?\nSpeaker A: i am not sure . do you have any pets ?\nSpeaker B: yup , i have a dog . how about you ?\nSpeaker A: i have a cat . did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks !\nSpeaker B: lol yeah , there s all sorts of cafes like that , i ve been to a meerkat cafe , a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before .\nSpeaker A: that is really interesting . i would like that . i wish i slept as much as cats . when a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping .\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of sleeping ! there s is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is a very strange name . i wonder if he ever got a cat named stubbs .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's a lot of soup . are you talking about the fort - reno concert ? i heard flasher will perform there \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ?
