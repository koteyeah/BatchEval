Speaker A suddenly claims to love Shakespeare and calls him an actor, which is incorrect. This is a major flaw.\n\nSample3: The response is somewhat relevant, but it's a bit confusing.

It doesn't add anything new or interesting to the conversation.\n\nSample7: The response is relevant and adds a fun fact to the conversation about quarterbacks.
