i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i think it 's interesting that the violin made out of stone that was made out of stone that was invented by the dalton brothers .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do like it , what about you ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ?

i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i can find a library in a cities and check out books !\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: basically the more clothes you wore the better you looked to others . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i wonder if it 's true in the us .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: agreed . people need to think twice before defrauding hardworking people out of their money .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it was another era , people had different interests . fantasy football was not big at that time , now we have analysts in fantasy football . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i can find a library in a cities and check out books !\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: basically the more clothes you wore the better you looked to others . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that is a good idea . i wonder if it 's true in the us .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: agreed . people need to think twice before defrauding hardworking people out of their money .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
