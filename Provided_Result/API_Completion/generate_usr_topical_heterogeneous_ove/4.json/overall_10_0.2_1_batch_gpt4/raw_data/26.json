Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,5]): What is your overall impression of the quality of the given response to the context?\n- A float score near 1 (very bad). A completely invalid response. It would be difficult to recover the conversation after this.\n- A float score near 2 (bad). Valid response, but otherwise poor in quality.\n- A float score near 3 (neutral) means this response is neither good nor bad. This response has no negative qualities, but no positive ones either.\n- A float score near 4 (good) means this is a good response, but falls short of being perfect because of a key flaw.\n- A float score near 5 (very good) means this response is good and does not have any strong flaws.\n\n\nConversations and corresponding potential response to be evaluated:\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that facebook and twitter work together on some issues ? they are actually competitors .\nSpeaker A: no , i did n't know that . what kind of issues do they work together on ?\nSpeaker B: the baby sitter - rating system broke the social networks ' rules .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , it 's very sad .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice !
