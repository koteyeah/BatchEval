otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: they are all great players . did you know women can also play in the nfl \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i am a fan of the nfl , i like the nfl , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: the lions love the patriots ! ! ! bill belichick is the best coach in postseason .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that rubbed me the wrong way as well . in general , she likes doing things on her own terms . she even walks backwards to avoid having her photo taken without her permission ! \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: they are all great players . did you know women can also play in the nfl \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i am a fan of the nfl , i like the nfl , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: the lions love the patriots ! ! ! bill belichick is the best coach in postseason .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ?

otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: they are all great players . did you know women can also play in the nfl \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i am a fan of the nfl , i like the nfl , what about you ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: the lions love the patriots ! ! ! bill belichick is the best coach in postseason .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that rubbed me the wrong way as well . in general , she likes doing things on her own terms . she even walks backwards to avoid having her photo taken without her permission ! \n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
