i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ?
