media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it must be a really strong cable for sure , so do you like cars ? you know the first car to be mass produced was a ford . \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation

occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was the right idea . i think it was great that native americans did that to the british who only used the breaststroke .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was

air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ;

?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do watch a lot of tv . i do n't watch much tv anymore .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello how are you doing ? reggie miller , nba hall of famer , could n't escape his older sister cheryl 's shadow while in high school . on january 26 , 1982 , he scored a career high 40 points . he tried bragging about it on the car ride home , only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records !\nSpeaker B: yes , and do you like basketball ?\nSpeaker A: i do nt keep track of all basketball but i do watch the warriors play . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles lakers .\nSpeaker A: james naismith , the inventor of basketball , is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history\nSpeaker B: james naismith wrote and developed the game 's original thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess so , i wonder if they share it for the state or if it is\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what 's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he 's the highest paid celebrity , followed by judge judy who makes $ 123,000 per episode !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what 's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he 's the highest paid celebrity , followed by judge judy who makes $ 123,000 per episode !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker

like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks

phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks

?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do watch a lot of tv . i do n't watch much tv anymore .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello how are you doing ? reggie miller , nba hall of famer ,

that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade

are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what 's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he 's the highest paid celebrity , followed by judge judy who makes $ 123,000 per episode !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he 's the highest paid celebrity , followed by judge judy who makes $ 123,000 per episode !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per

could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it must be a really strong cable for sure , so do you like cars ? you know the first car to be mass produced was a ford . \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not swim that much but i occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was the right idea . i think it was great that native americans did that to the british who only used the breaststroke .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was

air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ;

?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do watch a lot of tv . i do n't watch much tv anymore .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello how are you doing ? reggie miller , nba hall of famer ,

cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records !\nSpeaker B: yes , and do you like basketball ?\nSpeaker A: i do nt keep track of all basketball but i do watch the warriors play . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles lakers .\nSpeaker A: james naismith , the inventor of basketball , is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history\nSpeaker B: james naismith wrote and developed the game 's original thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess so , i wonder if they share it for the state or if it is\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you know much about the presidents ?\nSpeaker B: some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the us are ?\nSpeaker A: yes that us jfk , washington and jefferson\nSpeaker B: yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?\nSpeaker A: he was called president banana\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: wow cool . do you know how the vp used to be elected ?\nSpeaker B: yes that was the runner up during elections\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . the president of indonesia is a pop star\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what 's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're

basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade

sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what 's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he 's the highest paid celebrity , followed by judge judy who makes $ 123,000 per episode !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks

could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker

phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet

they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was the right idea . i think

you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles

television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what 's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he 's the highest paid celebrity , followed by judge judy who makes $ 123,000 per episode !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles

thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess so , i wonder if they share it for the state or if it

are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what 's their first thing about the celebrities ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: he 's the highest paid celebrity , followed by judge judy who makes $ 123,000 per episode !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
