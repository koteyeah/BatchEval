what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that is very impressive , i think he was the best qb ever ever\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you know much about presidents ?\nSpeaker A: i know they live in the white house !\nSpeaker B: did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house ?\nSpeaker A: nice . is that also true in ireland and france , where they have twin white house buildings ?\nSpeaker B: yeah but i do wonder if they presidents live in those houses or not\nSpeaker A: yeah , and since the white house still uses floppy disks , is this also true at the twin white houses ?\nSpeaker B: good point . i wonder if they use the floppy discs because they might still be safer\nSpeaker A: good question . perhaps , since teddy roosevelt banned christmas trees from the white house , perhaps bush issued an executive order against cds ?\nSpeaker B: well , it could be . good thing he brought back the solar panels though\nSpeaker A: true . although in 2011 , bullets struck the white house . it took the secret service 4 days to realize it . i wonder if the solar panels were damaged ?\nSpeaker B: good point and strange that they did not figure that out earlier\nSpeaker A: well , maybe they did n't notice because they were all inside listening to the latest pop music release from the president of indonesia ?\nSpeaker B: haha good point . did not know the guy released 3 albums already\nSpeaker A: the guy is a machine ! but he needs a better stage name . maybe president banana ?\nSpeaker B: i do not think the president of zimbabwe would be happy about that\nSpeaker A: he could be the artist formerly known as president banana ? i do n't really care as long as i can listen to him on the radio ! i love two things on my radio : indonesian pop music and electromagnetic storms from jupiter . those are my go to listening pleasures !\nSpeaker B: yeah that is so cool that if you turn your radio to am , you may capture jupiter 's storms\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i wonder if it 's still around in canada ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\nSpeaker A: i do nt even know what else they air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ; amazing !\nSpeaker A: i know right , seems crazy to have him in almost every one then to forget him completely in that one\nSpeaker B: do you still watch things on traditional tv ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i love the simpsons !\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: really , i hope that is ok for us ?

is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: really , i hope that is ok for us ?
