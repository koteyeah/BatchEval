i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , that was georgia tech vs cumberland . what a dominant victory .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , do you like swimming ?\nSpeaker A: hi there ! i do ! i love watching the olympic events . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: same here . i do not swim that much but i occasionally go to the pool every once and a while . i also enjoy watching swimming in the olympics ;\nSpeaker A: did you know cornell students are actually required to pass a basic swim test before they can graduate ?\nSpeaker B: i think that that is a good idea ! native americans also introduced the british to the front crawl .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was the right idea . i think it was great that native americans did that to the british who only used the breaststroke .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that the sun takes up 99.86 % of the mass of the solar system ?
