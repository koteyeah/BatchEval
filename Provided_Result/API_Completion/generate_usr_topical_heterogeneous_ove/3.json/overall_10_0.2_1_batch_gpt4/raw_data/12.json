pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ?

pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ?

the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ?

pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ?

the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ?
