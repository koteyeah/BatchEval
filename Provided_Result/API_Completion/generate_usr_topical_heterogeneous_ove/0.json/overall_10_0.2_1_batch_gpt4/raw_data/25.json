i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i think it 's interesting that the violin made out of stone that was made out of stone that was invented by the dalton brothers .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\nSpeaker A: i do nt even know what else they air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ; amazing !\nSpeaker A: i know right , seems crazy to have him in almost every one then to forget him completely in that one\nSpeaker B: do you still watch things on traditional tv ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do . i love the simpsons .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great player . he is the highest paid celebrity right ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i think it would be like the politicians .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that rubbed me the wrong way as well . in general , she likes doing things on her own terms . she even walks backwards to avoid having her photo taken without her permission ! \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to go to wrigley field . i would n't be able to go to a baseball game in my car , i could stay _unk to one of the cars .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ?

i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i think it 's interesting that the violin made out of stone that was made out of stone that was invented by the dalton brothers .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\nSpeaker A: i do nt even know what else they air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ; amazing !\nSpeaker A: i know right , seems crazy to have him in almost every one then to forget him completely in that one\nSpeaker B: do you still watch things on traditional tv ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do . i love the simpsons .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great player . he is the highest paid celebrity right ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i think it would be like the politicians .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ? by the way , are you a fan of taylor swift\nSpeaker B: i was until i knew she removed her music from spotify because \" music should not be free \"\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that rubbed me the wrong way as well . in general , she likes doing things on her own terms . she even walks backwards to avoid having her photo taken without her permission ! \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to go to wrigley field . i would n't be able to go to a baseball game in my car , i could stay _unk to one of the cars .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , do you like music ?\nSpeaker A: hi , yes i do . do you like music ?\nSpeaker B: very much , i was so excited to learn that \" /hybrid theory\"from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! !\nSpeaker A: did you ever have any cassette tapes ?\nSpeaker B: yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's\nSpeaker A: what di you do with all of those items ?

reggie miller , nba hall of famer , could n't escape his older sister cheryl 's shadow while in high school . on january 26 , 1982 , he scored a career high 40 points . he tried bragging about it on the car ride home , only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records !\nSpeaker B: yes , and do you like basketball ?\nSpeaker A: i do nt keep track of all basketball but i do watch the warriors play . how about you ?\nSpeaker B: yes , me also . but it 's very interesting game in the world .\nSpeaker A: it is , did you know nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $ 800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $ 32,000,000 .\nSpeaker B: national basketball association ( nba ) , professional basketball league formed in the united states in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations , the national basketball league ( founded 1937 ) and the basketball association of america ( founded 1946 ) .\nSpeaker A: oh i guess that s interesting .\nSpeaker B: by the early 1980s the nba was plagued by money - losing franchises , low attendance , declining television ratings , and limited national appeal . the league soon rebounded under the leadership of david stern , nba commissioner from 1984 , who helped transform it into an international entertainment company .\nSpeaker A: physicists proved that shooting \" granny style \" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line , but nba players refuse to do it because it looks stupid . maybe they should start shooting granny style again ! lol\nSpeaker B: yes , that 's nice .\nSpeaker A: kareem abdul - jabbar 's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade .\nSpeaker B: kareem abdul - jabbar is an american retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the national basketball association for the milwaukee bucks and the los angeles lakers .\nSpeaker A: james naismith , the inventor of basketball , is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history\nSpeaker B: james naismith wrote and developed the game 's original thirteen rules and , through the ymca network , quickly spread the news throughout the country .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if the highest paid employees are college football or basketball coaches ?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: morning ! are you a comedy fan ?\nSpeaker A: morning ! yes , some of it . have you watched anything good recently ?\nSpeaker B: kung fu hustle . ever seen it ? it 's hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i have n't ! what is it about ? does it have bruce lee in it ?\nSpeaker B: no , it 's much more recent . steven chow directed it . bill murray loved it too .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah bill murray called it \" the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy \" \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ;)\nSpeaker A: hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising .\nSpeaker B: does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising !\nSpeaker B: actress ? i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i think it 's interesting that the violin made out of stone that was made out of stone that was invented by the dalton brothers .\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: are you a game of thrones fan ?\nSpeaker A: no not really . i do nt have hbo so i do nt watch , you ?\nSpeaker B: i think i have only watch about a few minutes of it ; i do n't get it or like the genre\nSpeaker A: i tried to read one of the books and it was crazy to follow , i m more likely to watch documentaries or movies\nSpeaker B: same here . i like hbo for some of the other things they air but not got .\nSpeaker A: i do nt even know what else they air , i truly do nt watch much tv at all . maybe the simpsons once a while\nSpeaker B: i have watched the simpsons since i was a kid ; bart himself has only missed one episode this whole time ; amazing !\nSpeaker A: i know right , seems crazy to have him in almost every one then to forget him completely in that one\nSpeaker B: do you still watch things on traditional tv ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do . i love the simpsons .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like watching the n.b.a . ?\nSpeaker B: i do like to watch , my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now , how about you ?\nSpeaker A: so you 're a bucks fan ? how about giannis antetokounmpo ! he 's such a great player !\nSpeaker B: good call ! i have always been , watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back ! yeah giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization . do you have a favorite team ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm a memphis grizzlies fan , but enjoy watching a good game no matter who 's playing . i really like watching stephen curry and lebron james . did you know that they both were born in akron , ohio ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't know that about them , interesting . and the grizz , curious to see how you will be in a few seasons , was surprised to see gasol leave .\nSpeaker A: yeah , it 's hard to replace someone like him . i do like the pickup they made with noah . hopefully they 'll continue building up .\nSpeaker B: yeah and jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well .\nSpeaker A: did you know that air jordan 's were banned upon introduction by the nba ? however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great player . he is the highest paid celebrity right ?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: every us president with a beard has been a republican , that 's odd .\nSpeaker A: that is odd . so what do you think of trump .\nSpeaker B: i like trump\nSpeaker A: me too . i think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude .\nSpeaker B: yeah i never liked trump before he was president . i think he 's doing a great job with all that he 's been dealt .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i think it would be like the politicians .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: school shootings are so upsetting .\nSpeaker A: it is an unspeakable act\nSpeaker B: when kids have to question the president about why was a killer able to terrorize their school\nSpeaker A: it would be a challenge to answer . did you know that the only us president with a phd degree was woodrow wilson\nSpeaker B: i did nt know that . the u.s president 's guest house is larger than the white house\nSpeaker A: that is a very surprising fact . also , the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr\nSpeaker B: the wealthiest presidents are jfk , washington , jefferson . i thought trump would be lol\nSpeaker A: that surprised me too . where did they get their money from\nSpeaker B: inheritance probably . at least their name is not banana like the first president of zimbabwe\nSpeaker A: 1\nSpeaker B: yah and the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office\nSpeaker A: is it real ?
