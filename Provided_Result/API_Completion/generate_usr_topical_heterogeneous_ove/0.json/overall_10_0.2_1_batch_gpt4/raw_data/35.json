i do n't really care as long as i can listen to him on the radio ! i love two things on my radio : indonesian pop music and electromagnetic storms from jupiter . those are my go to listening pleasures !\nSpeaker B: yeah that is so cool that if you turn your radio to am , you may capture jupiter 's storms\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that might be banned in canada . the law says that all stations must have 40 % of the music played be canadian !\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you today ? do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ? was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i bet they did . i think creed should have a concert that was so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit against them .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that 's awesome ! the indians also have an uniforms because they can actually play for the field . the guy who is still invited to play baseball at the oracle arena !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .\nSpeaker A: i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .\nSpeaker B: what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .\nSpeaker A: that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .\nSpeaker A: oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .\nSpeaker B: i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .\nSpeaker A: i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .\nSpeaker B: women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?\nSpeaker A: this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .\nSpeaker B: belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to see that one ! i would love to see it !\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow that 's a lot of soup . are you talking about the fort - reno concert ? i heard flasher will perform there \n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how much the players made in the 1960s ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

It's a good response, but it could be more engaging or ask a question to keep the conversation going.\n\nSample 2: The response is relevant and continues the conversation about Trump. However, it's a bit confusing because it seems to suggest that Trump should have been a better candidate, even though he was already elected president.\n\nSample 3: The response is somewhat vague and doesn't directly address the topic of Facebook and Twitter working together.
