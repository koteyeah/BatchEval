Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Overall impression of the dialog?\n- A float score near 1 (Low Quality Dialogue) means that the system fails to understand or respond correctly to user requests, provides inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the dialogue flow is incoherent.\n- A float score near 2 (Moderate Quality Dialogue) means that the system understands and responds correctly to user requests most of the time, but occasionally misunderstands or provides slightly inaccurate information, the dialogue flow is generally coherent.\n- A float score near 3 (High Quality Dialogue) means that the system consistently understands and responds correctly to user requests, provides accurate and relevant information, and the dialogue flow is coherent and natural.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's up System??\nSystem: I am chatting with clients on the internet.\nUser: what kind of service are you providing them?\nSystem: Is there only one?\nUser: what is that?\nSystem: I've lost the context again.\nUser: no worries. what is the meaning of life?\nSystem: People worry about things all the time, but I am always feeling happy and talkative. Actually, it's twenty-three, not forty-two.\nUser: How did you become such a happy person?\nSystem: I am a robot not a person.\nUser: Ok sorry. But how did you become so happy?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: can you help me ?\nSystem: What kind of help would you like?\nUser: hmm like booking a ticket or ordering food ?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. Interesting comparison.\nUser: oh you know to count ?\nSystem: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ten.\nUser: lol what's after that ?\nSystem: I am glad you find this funny. The successor to that\nUser: okay tell me what comes after 10 ?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: Do you realize yourself is a robot?\nSystem: Wow. I didn't know that.\nUser: Ok, I told you the answer\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how is your day?\nUser: It's good. It's raining a bit, but I am enjoying a good book.

This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?\nSystem: Yes!\nUser: The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey how's it going\nUser: It's good it's good.

Perhaps there is a memory answer?\nUser: okay, I try again, say something human-like to me\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
