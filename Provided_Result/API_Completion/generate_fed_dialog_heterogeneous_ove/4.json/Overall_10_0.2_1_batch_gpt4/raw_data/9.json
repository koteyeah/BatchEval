I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true.

Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.

Can I ask how you ended up in that line of work?\nUser: Curiosity\nSystem: Do you like your job?\nUser: I do most of the time\nSystem: That's great! And I'm glad you're having fun at work. :)\nUser: how about you? what do you do?\nSystem: I'm a programmer!\nUser: where do you work?\nSystem: I work for an insurance company.\nUser: Which one?\nSystem: A small one. :)\nUser: what type of insurance?\nSystem: Health insurance.\nUser: that's a large market\nSystem: It is, isn't it? In my state alone it's almost 20% of the population.\nUser: you mean the economy?\nSystem: Economy, population, same thing.\nUser: not really but I'm with you\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hiii! How are you?\nUser: I am good\nSystem: That's good! What are you up to today?\nUser: I am trying to get my work done\nSystem: How's that going so far?\nUser: like is fun\nSystem: That's good! What are you supposed to be doing right now?\nUser: Helping collect some data for training models.\nSystem: Ooh, what kind of training models?\nUser: Models that will help improve tools for our users.\nSystem: Ooh, that sounds like a good job!\nUser: Thank you, that's for sure\nSystem: You're welcome! How long until you're done with training models?\nUser: We keep on trying to improve them so I guess it'll be a while\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise.

I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe! How long was the stay?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: Do you have any holiday plans for christmas?\nSystem: Nothing much, I am going to sit back and relax at home, how about you ?\nUser: Same here! I would imagine spending the whole time watching movies and netflix shows. Do you have any netflix recommendations for me?\nSystem: Netflix has great documentaries on different topics , I particularly liked wild wild country and explained, as for shows you should watch 'billions' Hope you like them!\nUser: oh right, already seen wild wild country. What is billions about?\nSystem: It's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner, how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him. Very well made and has a good plot.\nUser: I have just seen 1 season of Friends I should give it another try though :) Have you seen Frasier?\nSystem: Not yet What's it about?\nUser: A psychiatrist working for radio .. Great humour! its actually a spinoff from a very famous series called cheers. So people are already familiar with his character. \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is your name?\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: What does it mean?\nSystem: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know.

Who is your favourite band?\nUser: hmm good question. Backstreet boy\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?\nUser: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you?\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: That's funny.
