I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today.

Do you like it?\nUser: Yes.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?\nSystem: I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh.

How's it going?\nUser: What do you think about mind reading\nSystem: I think it's a neat ability when it's not abused.\nUser: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?\nSystem: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi!

What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea.

I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.\nUser: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?\nSystem: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.\nUser: Hehe, I need a demo first\nSystem: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.\nUser: How much do you expect?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi!

I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state\nSystem: Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!\nUser: Haha, thank you\nSystem: You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: Thanks, that means a lot\nSystem: Of course! I'm glad I could help!\nUser: What are you up to?\nSystem: Talking to you!\nUser: What about the rest of the day?\nSystem: Working!

I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.\nSystem: Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?\nUser: I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi!
