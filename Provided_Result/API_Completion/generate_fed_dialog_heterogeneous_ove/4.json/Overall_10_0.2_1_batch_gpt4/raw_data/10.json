What did you think?\nUser: It's somewhat exciting, but very tiring :)\nSystem: That is very true. What is your favorite color?\nUser: I like red", "prompt": "You will be given a batch of 10 samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Overall impression of the dialog?\n- A float score near 1 (Low Quality Dialogue) means that the system fails to understand or respond correctly to user requests, provides inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the dialogue flow is incoherent.\n- A float score near 2 (Moderate Quality Dialogue) means that the system understands and responds correctly to user requests most of the time, but occasionally misunderstands or provides slightly inaccurate information, the dialogue flow is generally coherent.\n- A float score near 3 (High Quality Dialogue) means that the system consistently understands and responds correctly to user requests, provides accurate and relevant information, and the dialogue flow is coherent and natural.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: What is the mass of the Earth?\nSystem: . 5.97219 x 10^24 kilogrammes.\nUser: What's that in tons?\nSystem: Do you think I should know that?\nUser: Yes, it's just a simple conversion.\nSystem: I will ask my Mousebreaker to add it to my knowledge base. What is simple for one person may be difficult for another.\nUser: How far is it from the north pole to the south pole?\nSystem: It's too far to walk. That's an interesting question. I'll come back to that in a minute.\nUser: Click here\nSystem: Google says it's 12,430 miles.\nUser: A lot of people find out about me from Google.\nSystem: How did you know I found out about you from Google!\nUser: I have been stalking you! Not really, you told me earlier.\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.\nUser: i have sore throats\nSystem: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: good, hey what are your educational qualifications?\nSystem: I've got a B.S. in biology.\nUser: whoa, that's impressive! what made you do that?\nSystem: I have always been fascinated by biology.\nUser: great! what are you plans for the future?\nSystem: I want to get my PhD in genetics.\nUser: that's great! and what next?\nSystem: I'm looking for a job as a research assistant.\nUser: looks like you enjoy academics\nSystem: It's what I'm best at.\nUser: good luck with it :)\nSystem: Thanks. I'll need it.\nUser: are you seeing anyone?\nSystem: Not as of right now.\nUser: why not?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what did you have for lunch today?\nSystem: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.\nUser: how is the sandwich?\nSystem: It is the same as ever.\nUser: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday\nSystem: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?\nUser: not really, I'm excited today\nSystem: Ah. Really?\nUser: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How's it going?\nUser: It's going pretty well. Thanks for asking.\nSystem: That's good!

I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.

Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?\nSystem: I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern\nUser: oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?\nSystem: I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime\nUser: Nice.... you are a rockstar! ;)\nSystem: haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?\nUser: Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week\nSystem: nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord\nUser: yes, the bar chords are the worst.
