Can't believe we are finally talking!\nUser: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe! How long was the stay?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's your day going?\nUser: busy yours?\nSystem: Mine's been pretty uneventful so far!\nUser: what are doing right now?\nSystem: Just been playing a bit of Hearthstone, and now I'm listening to some music! What about you?\nUser: which music?\nSystem: Just some random stuff on Spotify!\nUser: you have a paid subscription of it?\nSystem: Yeah, it's really good!\nUser: how much does it cost?\nSystem: It's  \u2047 9.99 a month!\nUser: that's cheap!\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is the capital of Brazil?\nSystem: I think the capital of Brazil is called \"Brasilia\".\nUser: How many people live there?\nSystem: Is unknown a country?

Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.

Do you have any netflix recommendations for me?\nSystem: Netflix has great documentaries on different topics , I particularly liked wild wild country and explained, as for shows you should watch 'billions' Hope you like them!\nUser: oh right, already seen wild wild country. What is billions about?\nSystem: It's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner, how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him. Very well made and has a good plot.\nUser: I have just seen 1 season of Friends I should give it another try though :) Have you seen Frasier?\nSystem: Not yet What's it about?\nUser: A psychiatrist working for radio ..

Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!\nUser: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe! How long was the stay?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's your day going?\nUser: busy yours?\nSystem: Mine's been pretty uneventful so far!\nUser: what are doing right now?\nSystem: Just been playing a bit of Hearthstone, and now I'm listening to some music! What about you?\nUser: which music?\nSystem: Just some random stuff on Spotify!\nUser: you have a paid subscription of it?\nSystem: Yeah, it's really good!\nUser: how much does it cost?\nSystem: It's  \u2047 9.99 a month!\nUser: that's cheap!\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is the capital of Brazil?\nSystem: I think the capital of Brazil is called \"Brasilia\".\nUser: How many people live there?\nSystem: Is unknown a country?

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did.

Can't believe we are finally talking!\nUser: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.

So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did.

Can't believe we are finally talking!\nUser: Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?\nSystem: It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.\nUser: Hehe! How long was the stay?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How's your day going?\nUser: busy yours?\nSystem: Mine's been pretty uneventful so far!\nUser: what are doing right now?\nSystem: Just been playing a bit of Hearthstone, and now I'm listening to some music!

Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now.
