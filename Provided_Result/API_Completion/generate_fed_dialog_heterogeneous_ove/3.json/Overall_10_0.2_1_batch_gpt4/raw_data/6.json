How are you?\nSystem: good. it's really hot today. I think I'm going to the pool\nUser: Oh nice! Where do you live?\nSystem: I live in Tokyo, Japan\nUser: Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....\nSystem: oh have you been?\nUser: Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!\nSystem: what did you do here?\nUser: Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha\nSystem: lol why did you come to Japan just to go to Disney land?\nUser: The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How are you? :)\nUser: Sleepy, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well!

I'm glad I could help!\nUser: What are you up to?\nSystem: Talking to you!\nUser: What about the rest of the day?\nSystem: Working! How about you?\nUser: Same, well hardly working\nSystem: What part of the world are you in, if you don't mind my asking?\nUser: California\nSystem: Nice! How do you like living there?\nUser: It's nice, I enjoy the warmth\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.\nUser: i have sore throats\nSystem: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hello, Nice to meet you\nSystem: If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?\nUser: Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?\nSystem: I think ice-cream. It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha\nUser: I love ice cream too!\nSystem: Okay, top three flavors?\nUser: I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?\nSystem: Ah, that's a good way of framing it. Me, I like berries: boysenberry one, strawberry two, maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit.\nUser: Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?\nSystem: Yes. I wonder if I'm in it right now. How would I know? What do you think?\nUser: I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.\nSystem: There's a mental world, I suppose?
