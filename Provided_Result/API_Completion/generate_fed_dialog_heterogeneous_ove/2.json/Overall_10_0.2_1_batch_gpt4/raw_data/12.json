Do you have steady hands?\nUser: Kind of I think", "prompt": "You will be given a batch of 5 samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Overall impression of the dialog?\n- A float score near 1 (Low Quality Dialogue) means that the system fails to understand or respond correctly to user requests, provides inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the dialogue flow is incoherent.\n- A float score near 2 (Moderate Quality Dialogue) means that the system understands and responds correctly to user requests most of the time, but occasionally misunderstands or provides slightly inaccurate information, the dialogue flow is generally coherent.\n- A float score near 3 (High Quality Dialogue) means that the system consistently understands and responds correctly to user requests, provides accurate and relevant information, and the dialogue flow is coherent and natural.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?\nUser: I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?\nSystem: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)\nUser: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)\nSystem: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nUser: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nSystem: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. \nUser: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. \nSystem: I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?\nUser: That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)\nSystem: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?\nUser: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nSystem:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music\nUser: Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! \n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How have you been\nUser: great! just came back from a ski trip\nSystem: How was it? What trails did you ski on?\nUser: I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha\nSystem: a resort in Montreal\nUser: Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it\nSystem: Yeah I grew up speaking it. It's pretty much mandatory here\nUser: Did you go anywhere else in montreal?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What is the capital of Brazil?\nSystem: I think the capital of Brazil is called \"Brasilia\".\nUser: How many people live there?\nSystem: Is unknown a country? I only know countries, not towns or cities.\nUser: Do more people live in the USA or Australia?\nSystem: Not that much more, no.\nUser: What other subjects do you know about besides Geography?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you?\nUser: Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good\nSystem: ohh, what kind of \"hint\" did it have?\nUser: watermelon\nSystem: nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor\nUser: I see. Yeah some are pretty strange\nSystem: Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?\nUser: lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird\nSystem: haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream\nUser: that sounds pretty tasty actually\nSystem: It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad\nUser: do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place\nSystem: As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places\nUser: lol\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: How's it going?\nUser: I'm so sleepy today!\nSystem: Not enough sleep last night?\nUser: yeah was working all night on a homework\nSystem: Oh really? What class?\nUser: Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha\nSystem: Haha, are you in med school? Or are you pre-med?\nUser: no high school actually haha\nSystem: haha, very ambitious for a high schooler! Do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice?\nUser: I wanna be a brain surgeon!!\nSystem: Ooof! VERY ambitious. Do you have steady hands?\nUser: Kind of I think\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample. Analysis:\" to analyze the given samples regarding the evaluation criteria as concise as possible (Attention: Don't give your scores during this step). After analysing all the samples, please give all the float scores in order following the template \"Float Scores: [Sample1:score of Sample1,...,Sample5:score of Sample5]\".\n- Overall:\n"}], "response": ["I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample. Analysis:\n\nSample1: The system responds accurately and relevantly to the user's inquiries, providing detailed information about a book it has written. The dialogue flows naturally, with the system asking the user about their priorities in life and sharing its own. The system also shows understanding of the user's statements and responds appropriately.\n\nSample2: The system's responses are generally relevant, but there are a couple of instances where it seems to misunderstand the user. For example, the user mentions slamming into an ice wall during a ski trip, but the system doesn't acknowledge this and asks about a resort in Montreal. Later, the system seems to respond to a question the user didn't ask. The dialogue flow is somewhat disjointed as a result.\n\nSample3: The system correctly identifies the capital of Brazil, but fails to provide the population when asked. It also misunderstands the user's question about whether more people live in the USA or Australia. The system's responses are generally relevant, but these misunderstandings disrupt the dialogue flow.\n\nSample4: The system responds accurately and relevantly to the user's statements, engaging in a discussion about different flavors of water and ice cream. The dialogue flows naturally, with the system asking the user about their experiences and sharing its own.\n\nSample5: The system responds accurately and relevantly to the user's statements, asking about their sleep and their studies. The dialogue flows naturally, with the system showing interest in the user's ambition to become a brain surgeon and asking if they have steady hands.\n\nFloat Scores: [Sample1:3, Sample2:1.8, Sample3:1.5, Sample4:3, Sample5:3]"]}
