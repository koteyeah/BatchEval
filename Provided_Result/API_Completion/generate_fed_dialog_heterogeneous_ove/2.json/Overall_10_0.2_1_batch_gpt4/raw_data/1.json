I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.\nUser: Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?\nSystem: Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.
