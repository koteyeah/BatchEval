Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Overall impression of the dialog?\n- A float score near 1 (Low Quality Dialogue) means that the system fails to understand or respond correctly to user requests, provides inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the dialogue flow is incoherent.\n- A float score near 2 (Moderate Quality Dialogue) means that the system understands and responds correctly to user requests most of the time, but occasionally misunderstands or provides slightly inaccurate information, the dialogue flow is generally coherent.\n- A float score near 3 (High Quality Dialogue) means that the system consistently understands and responds correctly to user requests, provides accurate and relevant information, and the dialogue flow is coherent and natural.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hello, Nice to meet you\nSystem: If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?\nUser: Hmm...

It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha\nUser: I love ice cream too!\nSystem: Okay, top three flavors?\nUser: I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?\nSystem: Ah, that's a good way of framing it. Me, I like berries: boysenberry one, strawberry two, maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit.\nUser: Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?\nSystem: Yes. I wonder if I'm in it right now. How would I know? What do you think?\nUser: I think so.

Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\nUser: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\nSystem: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\nUser: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\nSystem: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.\nUser: What's the most recent good thing you read?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: Do you realize yourself is a robot?\nSystem: Wow.
