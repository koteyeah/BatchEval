So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting!

How's it going?\nUser: Hi, how are you?\nSystem: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you?\nUser: I'm fine. What's up?\nSystem: Not much. How about you?\nUser: nothing new. Anything exciting happening recently?\nSystem: Not really. You?\nUser: I watched a movie recently which was pretty good\nSystem: That's good. What movie?\nUser: the irishman, have you seen it?\nSystem: I have not. Should I?\nUser: I think so\nSystem: Alright, I'll put it on my watch list.\nUser: How about you? Have you watched anything interesting recently?\nSystem: I've been waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.\nUser: what is it about?\nSystem: The adventures of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\nUser: when was it released?\nSystem: It just came out today.\nUser: are you sure, I think it's been out for a while\nSystem: I'm positive.

Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool.

I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay.
