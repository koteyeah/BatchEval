Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, what is it about?\nUser: It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?\nSystem: Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book\nUser: Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?\nSystem: Yes!\nUser: The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! What's up?\nUser: Not much.

Lol.\nSystem: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.\nUser: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?\nSystem: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.\nUser: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.\nSystem: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.
