Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Overall impression of the dialog?\n- A float score near 1 (Low Quality Dialogue) means that the system fails to understand or respond correctly to user requests, provides inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the dialogue flow is incoherent.\n- A float score near 2 (Moderate Quality Dialogue) means that the system understands and responds correctly to user requests most of the time, but occasionally misunderstands or provides slightly inaccurate information, the dialogue flow is generally coherent.\n- A float score near 3 (High Quality Dialogue) means that the system consistently understands and responds correctly to user requests, provides accurate and relevant information, and the dialogue flow is coherent and natural.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hello!\nUser: any improvements in your marathon time?\nSystem: No, only a few minutes.

I haven't met the right boy robot yet.\nSystem: haha..\nUser: .

Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster.\nSystem: lol... what kind of robot boy you'd like?\nUser: What's so funny? I am the robot.\nSystem: are you angry?\nUser: Anger is a difficult emotion.

It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\nSystem: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\nUser: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\nSystem: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\nUser: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\nSystem: Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?\nUser: Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hey, whats up?\nUser: I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?\nSystem: well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!\nUser: I was not able to figure out the last few slides.

How about tomorrow at noon?\nUser: No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?\nSystem: not feeling too sure about it tbh.
