I've visited India before.\nSystem: Hyderabad, it is a beautiful city in the southern part of India. Which cities have you gone to in India?\nUser: Hyderabad! and Bangalore! Great food in both cities! Is it still hot this time of year?\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: hello there, nice seeing you\nUser: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?\nSystem: oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?\nUser: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that.
