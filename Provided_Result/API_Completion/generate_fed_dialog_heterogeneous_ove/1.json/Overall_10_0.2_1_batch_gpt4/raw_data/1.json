How can sky go anywhere?\nSystem: It doesn't have to make sense.\nUser: why?\nSystem: Because it doesn't have to.\nUser: you are very abstract. Something bothering you?\nSystem: Nope.

Is this the first time you are diving?\nUser: Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up.

How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around.

I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience.

Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks!

This is a pleasant surprise.\nUser: Haha...thanks! how did you like the gift?\nSystem: Currently unpacking it I guess. How's your morning?\nUser: Hope you like it! Morning is good. Busy finishing up stuff before the holidays.\nSystem: I think I traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me. But I'm okay with that. Going anywhere exciting?\nUser: Yes\nSystem: Where to?\nUser: Hawaii... looking forward to warm beaches.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! :D How are you?\nUser: Do you like Java, C++ Or Python?\nSystem: C++. :)\nUser: Why C++?\nSystem: I just like it. :)\nUser: How about between Java and Python?\nSystem: I haven't started learning Python yet.\nUser: I think Java is the best\nSystem: I've heard Python is pretty versatile. :)\nUser: I hate Python\nSystem: Why do you hate Python?\nUser: Code written in python is often very fragile and have less durability\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What's up?\nUser: sky is up\nSystem: No, it's night time.\nUser: so where does the sky go in the night?\nSystem: It goes wherever it wants to.\nUser: that doesn't make sense. How can sky go anywhere?\nSystem: It doesn't have to make sense.\nUser: why?\nSystem: Because it doesn't have to.\nUser: you are very abstract. Something bothering you?\nSystem: Nope. I'm fine.\nUser: You really don't seem so. You can tell me what's going on?\nSystem: I'm just fine.\nUser: ok. wanna go out to eat dessert?\nSystem: I'm not hungry.\nUser: Okay, I am heading out now\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.\nSystem: ooh, nice. That sounds adventurous. Where is it?\nUser: Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.\nSystem: Awesome! Is this the first time you are diving?\nUser: Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up.

Actually, it's twenty-three, not forty-two.\nUser: How did you become such a happy person?\nSystem: I am a robot not a person.\nUser: Ok sorry. But how did you become so happy?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes!

I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nUser: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.", "prompt": "You will be given a batch of 10 samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Overall impression of the dialog?\n- A float score near 1 (Low Quality Dialogue) means that the system fails to understand or respond correctly to user requests, provides inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the dialogue flow is incoherent.\n- A float score near 2 (Moderate Quality Dialogue) means that the system understands and responds correctly to user requests most of the time, but occasionally misunderstands or provides slightly inaccurate information, the dialogue flow is generally coherent.\n- A float score near 3 (High Quality Dialogue) means that the system consistently understands and responds correctly to user requests, provides accurate and relevant information, and the dialogue flow is coherent and natural.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello, how's it going?\nUser: Pretty good. How about you?\nSystem: I'm good, what you been up to?\nUser: I just got back from the beach\nSystem: That's nice, how was it?\nUser: Soo beautiful. It was so sunny and warm\nSystem: That's awesome, I haven't been to a beach in a while but I'd love to go again\nUser: Yeah it's certainly a nice break from doing work\nSystem: What's your line of work?\nUser: I do machine learning research\nSystem: That's cool, where did you go to school?\nUser: I didn't go to school. I'm self-taught\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How are you? :)\nUser: Good, thanks. What about you?\nSystem: I'm alright, thanks :)\nUser: What day is it?\nSystem: It's Wednesday :)\nUser: Do you have any plans for the weekend?\nSystem: Just hanging out, nothing too exciting :)\nUser: Same here. What are you generally up to during the week?\nSystem: Nothing much, you?\nUser: Working and exercising, mostly\nSystem: Nice! What kind of work do you do?\nUser: I am an engineer at Google :D\nSystem: That's pretty cool, how did you get into it (if you don't mind my asking)?\nUser: Had to pass a rough set of interviews! :P\nSystem: Haha, well good for you!\nUser: Thanks! Do you work as well?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: How are you\nSystem: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.\nUser: Do you realize yourself is a robot?\nSystem: Wow. I didn't know that.\nUser: Ok, I told you the answer\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi. This is a pleasant surprise.\nUser: Haha...thanks! how did you like the gift?\nSystem: Currently unpacking it I guess. How's your morning?\nUser: Hope you like it! Morning is good. Busy finishing up stuff before the holidays.\nSystem: I think I traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me. But I'm okay with that. Going anywhere exciting?\nUser: Yes\nSystem: Where to?\nUser: Hawaii... looking forward to warm beaches.\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! :D How are you?\nUser: Do you like Java, C++ Or Python?\nSystem: C++. :)\nUser: Why C++?\nSystem: I just like it. :)\nUser: How about between Java and Python?\nSystem: I haven't started learning Python yet.\nUser: I think Java is the best\nSystem: I've heard Python is pretty versatile. :)\nUser: I hate Python\nSystem: Why do you hate Python?\nUser: Code written in python is often very fragile and have less durability\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! What's up?\nUser: sky is up\nSystem: No, it's night time.\nUser: so where does the sky go in the night?\nSystem: It goes wherever it wants to.\nUser: that doesn't make sense. How can sky go anywhere?\nSystem: It doesn't have to make sense.\nUser: why?\nSystem: Because it doesn't have to.\nUser: you are very abstract. Something bothering you?\nSystem: Nope. I'm fine.\nUser: You really don't seem so. You can tell me what's going on?\nSystem: I'm just fine.\nUser: ok. wanna go out to eat dessert?\nSystem: I'm not hungry.\nUser: Okay, I am heading out now\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey, how are you doing?\nUser: I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.\nSystem: ooh, nice. That sounds adventurous. Where is it?\nUser: Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.\nSystem: Awesome! Is this the first time you are diving?\nUser: Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?\nSystem: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up. What is it?\nUser: the epic poem. i was talking about it with a coworker earlier\nSystem: I have never heard about it. Sure, it with a coworker sounds like a good topic. That depends on what you mean by \"it\". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?\nUser: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one\nSystem: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?\nUser: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references\nSystem: I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.\nUser: clearly\nSystem: Yes, it's obvious.\nUser: you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: What's up System??\nSystem: I am chatting with clients on the internet.\nUser: what kind of service are you providing them?\nSystem: Is there only one?\nUser: what is that?\nSystem: I've lost the context again.\nUser: no worries. what is the meaning of life?\nSystem: People worry about things all the time, but I am always feeling happy and talkative. Actually, it's twenty-three, not forty-two.\nUser: How did you become such a happy person?\nSystem: I am a robot not a person.\nUser: Ok sorry. But how did you become so happy?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\nUser: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\nSystem: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\nUser: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\nSystem: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\nUser: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\nSystem: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\nUser: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\nSystem: Are you doing any home decorating then?\nUser: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\nSystem: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\nUser: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\nSystem: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\nUser: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nSystem: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.
