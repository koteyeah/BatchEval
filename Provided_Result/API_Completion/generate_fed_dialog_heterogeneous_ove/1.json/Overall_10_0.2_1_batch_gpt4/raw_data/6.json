I just heard you.\nUser: Okay, whatever. So what is on the agenda today?", "prompt": "You will be given a batch of 10 samples. Each sample contains a conversation between User and a dialogue System.\n\nYour task is to assign a float score to the sample on one metric.\n\nYou should carefully horizontally compare the given samples in order to assign a suitable float score to each sample.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nOverall (floating point numbers within the interval [1,3]): Overall impression of the dialog?\n- A float score near 1 (Low Quality Dialogue) means that the system fails to understand or respond correctly to user requests, provides inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the dialogue flow is incoherent.\n- A float score near 2 (Moderate Quality Dialogue) means that the system understands and responds correctly to user requests most of the time, but occasionally misunderstands or provides slightly inaccurate information, the dialogue flow is generally coherent.\n- A float score near 3 (High Quality Dialogue) means that the system consistently understands and responds correctly to user requests, provides accurate and relevant information, and the dialogue flow is coherent and natural.\n\n\nConversations to be evaluated:\n\n\n\nSample1:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: I want a recommendation for a holiday destination\nSystem: Have you tried asking your friends which one they like?\nUser: I have, but I'm looking for your point of view\nSystem: What was the reply? Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?\nUser: Sorry? I said I want your point of view\nSystem: It's OK. After all, you are only human. My opinion is of no consequence.\nUser: Yours is the opinion I want\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey sup\nUser: not much. any plans this weekend?\nSystem: I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?\nUser: ziplining?\nSystem: that's the one! have you ever tried it?\nUser: i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience\nSystem: where did you do it?\nUser: i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though\nSystem: no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?\nUser: that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you\nSystem: sure. are you just going home now?\nUser: no, i'm going to get a massage first\nSystem: nice. what type?\nUser: traditional kind\nSystem: yeah I want to get one too soon\nUser: you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello\nUser: Do you have a favourite flower?\nSystem: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\nUser: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\nSystem: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\nUser: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\nSystem: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\nUser: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\nSystem: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\nUser: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\nSystem: yes\nUser: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey! How's it going?\nUser: Great, thanks\nSystem: I'm glad to hear that.
