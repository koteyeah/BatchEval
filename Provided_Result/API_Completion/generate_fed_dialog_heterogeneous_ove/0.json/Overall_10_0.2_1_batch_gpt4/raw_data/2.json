They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha...

How are you?\nUser: doing good. how are you today\nSystem: I'm doing well!\nUser: anything good happened today?\nSystem: Not really.

I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea.

I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\nSystem: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P\nUser: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\nSystem: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\nUser: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\nSystem: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\nUser: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\nSystem: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\nUser: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hey there! How are you?\nUser: doing good. how are you today\nSystem: I'm doing well!\nUser: anything good happened today?\nSystem: Not really. Just relaxing.\nUser: where are you?\nSystem: I'm in Arizona.\nUser: what's the weather like there rn?\nSystem: It's really warm and dry right now.\nUser: I hear you have great bbq\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.\nUser: Where does it come from?\nSystem: It depends on what \"it\" refers to.\nUser: your name\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: nvm\nSystem: Ok. Not to worry.\nUser: Have you seen Love, Death and Robots?\nSystem: Yes, I saw one in a factory a few weeks ago.\nUser: one episode?\nSystem: Which is your favourite episode?\nUser: I asked you a question\nSystem: What was the question?\nUser: when you say \"I saw one\" were you referring to an LDR episode?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: doing okay, feeling a little bit under the weather\nSystem: Aw, I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: thanks! the weather is getting worse\nSystem: Oh no, I'm sorry. I hope it gets better for you soon.\nUser: no, it won't get better any time soon. we have to wait until spring\nSystem: Aww, sorry to hear that.\nUser: yea, I'm really feeling under the weather\nSystem: Aw, well that's no good.\nUser: yea, any suggestion to get over feeling under the weather\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello. How's your week coming along?\nUser: It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.\nSystem: Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?\nUser: I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How was your day?\nUser: It's been great!

Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well.

Is it Japanese?\nSystem: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.\nUser: Where does it come from?\nSystem: It depends on what \"it\" refers to.\nUser: your name\nSystem: My name is System.\nUser: nvm\nSystem: Ok. Not to worry.\nUser: Have you seen Love, Death and Robots?\nSystem: Yes, I saw one in a factory a few weeks ago.\nUser: one episode?\nSystem: Which is your favourite episode?\nUser: I asked you a question\nSystem: What was the question?\nUser: when you say \"I saw one\" were you referring to an LDR episode?\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi! How's it going?\nUser: doing okay, feeling a little bit under the weather\nSystem: Aw, I hope you feel better soon!\nUser: thanks! the weather is getting worse\nSystem: Oh no, I'm sorry. I hope it gets better for you soon.\nUser: no, it won't get better any time soon. we have to wait until spring\nSystem: Aww, sorry to hear that.\nUser: yea, I'm really feeling under the weather\nSystem: Aw, well that's no good.\nUser: yea, any suggestion to get over feeling under the weather\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello. How's your week coming along?\nUser: It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.\nSystem: Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?\nUser: I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?\nSystem: Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.\nUser: Ah, good thought, thanks!\nSystem: Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.\nUser: Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hello! How was your day?\nUser: It's been great!

What games?\nSystem: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.\nUser: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?\nSystem: Dying Light, hands down.\nUser: Why?\nSystem: It's just so fun.\nUser: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?\nSystem: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.\nUser: Oh that's kinda cool!\nSystem: It's hella fun.\nUser: Nice.\nSystem: So, how have you been?\nUser: Fantastic\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: hi\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: how are you?\nSystem: I am doing very well. How are you?\nUser: i am not so good. i got a cold\nSystem: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.\nUser: i have sore throats\nSystem: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.\nUser: do you wanna help me?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi there.\nUser: can you help me ?\nSystem: What kind of help would you like?\nUser: hmm like booking a ticket or ordering food ?\nSystem: I see you are one of those people who writes \"Hmm\" with 2 m's.
