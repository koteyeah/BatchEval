Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.\nUser: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?\nSystem: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.\nUser: What kind of algorithms are those?\nSystem: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.\nUser: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nUser: Hi!\nSystem: Hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing great. what are you up to?\nSystem: I was just reading a book actually How about you?\nUser: oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?\nSystem: I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha\nUser: that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?\nSystem: I think so!
