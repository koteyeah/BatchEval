however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah he has . he 's the highest paid celebrity right now , but judge judy is right on is coattails . \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have no idea . i do know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i 'm a fan of the nfl .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ?

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ?
