haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i would love to have one of those ! i would n't want to own a car , but it 's a bit scary , because it 's too dangerous for me !\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i think it 's crazy that the highest scoring football game ever was 222 - 0 .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think the government is supposed to be an absolute state employees . i think that 's the reason they do that .\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i wonder what the president of zimbabwe looks like ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ?
