i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ?

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ?

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: leadership is very important in sports . that 's why coaches are so important ! bill belicick is an nfl coach with 21 wins , the most in the nfl . he must be a great leader !\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi . i heard an interesting fact recently . did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington , jefferson , and jfk ?\nSpeaker B: hello , they must have accomplished to people 's satisfactions .\nSpeaker A: i guess so . you know , in different countries a president has different roles and functions .\nSpeaker B: i bet they do . the first president was named president banana in zimbabwe .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if they have a different name like the president of indonesia 's book .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you today ?

i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i would be curious . there is only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . i wonder who they are ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm not sure either . i do n't recall any african american artists in country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know . i love country music . i think i 've heard that u2 once opened for themselves in 1987 . they were actually opened for themselves and then became the dalton brothers from galveston tx .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi ! do you follow football ?\nSpeaker B: sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .\nSpeaker A: that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .\nSpeaker B: i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?\nSpeaker A: yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .\nSpeaker B: now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .\nSpeaker A: he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .\nSpeaker B: do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a great game to watch . i would have to be a bit slow .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah that would be crazy . if earths history was represented as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 min and 17 seconds lol its sometimes so surprising how small we are in the universe . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ?
