well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , i think it was a great movie , i liked it a lot more than the movie , you should watch it again\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ?

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , i think it was a great movie , i liked it a lot more than the movie , you should watch it again\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

what is your favorite nfl team ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think they are more about the third quarter back , it 's like a mini super bowl bowl for a reason\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: good morning ! have you seen the incredibles 2 movie ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i love everything pixar is a part of doing !\nSpeaker A: the director for the 2nd movie actually used artists who were either likely to quit or get fired from pixar .\nSpeaker B: cool . do you know who wrote that movie ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i know that the director actually voiced one of the characters , because the production team could n't find anybody better than him !\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard of doug harey ?\nSpeaker A: was n't he an umpire for the mlb ?\nSpeaker B: yes he just died at 87 years of age .\nSpeaker A: i guess he was a big deal , and he lived quite a while . he 'll be missed though\nSpeaker B: he must 've been an interesting character to earn the nick name ' god ' .\nSpeaker A: he was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing\nSpeaker B: yup , he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games .\nSpeaker A: and five world series , which is a big leagues in the mlb . he was n't intimidated by anyone , it seems\nSpeaker B: he was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903 .\nSpeaker A: that 's incredible ! do you pay attention to baseball much ?\nSpeaker B: no i did when i was younger but lost interest . how bout you ?\nSpeaker A: every once in a while . it 's one of those sports i would rather play than watch . the japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name \" national pastime \" from the americans if they could\nSpeaker B: yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too .\nSpeaker A: enough that people used to collect baseball cards . one man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million dollars\nSpeaker B: that s a lot of money . are any managers cards worth anything ? they do wear the uniform after all .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yes , that 's true . there was a movie about the world series called a philadelphia battle in the 1940 's .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i 'm a fan of the nfl .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do buy a lot from amazon . jeff bezos probably built a clock into a mountain to make sure that we would be able to tell time for 10,000 years .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i 'm a fan of the infielders as well . i feel like people need to giving more attention to the managers . technically they 're allowed to play for their team if needed \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , i think it was a great movie , i liked it a lot more than the movie , you should watch it again\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he is . he is the winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
