do you like to go to concerts ?\nSpeaker B: not as much as i used to but i do .\nSpeaker A: yeah , same here ! creed gave a concert so bad there were lawsuits against the band .\nSpeaker B: ha ha . i hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a creed fan i find that hilarious .\nSpeaker A: i do n't know much about that band . the sound in the ancient roman amphitheater must be good for pink floyd to record in it without an audience .\nSpeaker B: i wonder why they did that . it would be such a beautiful place to be an audience member .\nSpeaker A: yes , i like the live albums.the ancient roman amphitheatre still has concerts .\nSpeaker B: oh wow . are you familiar with lou reed ?\nSpeaker A: yes , i am . i have heard a few of his songs .\nSpeaker B: in 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs . what an odd thing to do .\nSpeaker A: oh wow ! really , did the dogs like it ?

i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: right ! as a matter of fact , the fiddle and the violin are the same instrument . what sets them apart from each other is the type of music its used to play . i always think of a violin as fancier than a fiddle . \n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , it was a great movie , the first incredibles was based on a video game called incredibles , the incredibles , the sequel , i think that was a great movie\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't have a kindle , but i have n't been to the library in sacramento .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , but i guess it makes sense . i do know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like fish ?\nSpeaker B: i do , tasty animals , do you ?\nSpeaker A: fish is practically a vegetable . they are the food that my food eats .\nSpeaker B: yeah except for fish like the black swallower fish , i hear that one likes to bite\nSpeaker A: i envy that fish 's ability to eat . that is a glorious spectacle . i would go to the buffet everyday .\nSpeaker B: buffet is my favorite kind of restaurant so yea , did you hear about that breed of jellyfish , the one that is immortal !\nSpeaker A: i did not . i wonder what it does all day with its unending life . must get kinda boring . who does it talk to ? what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the genes that are used to the same as the zebrafish .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ? ca n't get any more quirky than that .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ?

was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow i wonder if anybody sued them . four people sued creed for performing very badly at a concert in 2002 .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ;)\nSpeaker A: hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising .\nSpeaker B: does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising !\nSpeaker B: actress ? i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: right ! as a matter of fact , the fiddle and the violin are the same instrument . what sets them apart from each other is the type of music its used to play . i always think of a violin as fancier than a fiddle . \n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , it was a great movie , the first incredibles was based on a video game called incredibles , the incredibles , the sequel , i think that was a great movie\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't have a kindle , but i have n't been to the library in sacramento .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , but i guess it makes sense . i do know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like fish ?\nSpeaker B: i do , tasty animals , do you ?\nSpeaker A: fish is practically a vegetable . they are the food that my food eats .\nSpeaker B: yeah except for fish like the black swallower fish , i hear that one likes to bite\nSpeaker A: i envy that fish 's ability to eat . that is a glorious spectacle . i would go to the buffet everyday .\nSpeaker B: buffet is my favorite kind of restaurant so yea , did you hear about that breed of jellyfish , the one that is immortal !\nSpeaker A: i did not . i wonder what it does all day with its unending life . must get kinda boring . who does it talk to ? what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the genes that are used to the same as the zebrafish .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ?

run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow i wonder if anybody sued them . four people sued creed for performing very badly at a concert in 2002 .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ;)\nSpeaker A: hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising .\nSpeaker B: does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising !\nSpeaker B: actress ? i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: right ! as a matter of fact , the fiddle and the violin are the same instrument . what sets them apart from each other is the type of music its used to play . i always think of a violin as fancier than a fiddle . \n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , it was a great movie , the first incredibles was based on a video game called incredibles , the incredibles , the sequel , i think that was a great movie\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't have a kindle , but i have n't been to the library in sacramento .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , but i guess it makes sense . i do know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like fish ?\nSpeaker B: i do , tasty animals , do you ?\nSpeaker A: fish is practically a vegetable . they are the food that my food eats .\nSpeaker B: yeah except for fish like the black swallower fish , i hear that one likes to bite\nSpeaker A: i envy that fish 's ability to eat . that is a glorious spectacle . i would go to the buffet everyday .\nSpeaker B: buffet is my favorite kind of restaurant so yea , did you hear about that breed of jellyfish , the one that is immortal !\nSpeaker A: i did not . i wonder what it does all day with its unending life . must get kinda boring . who does it talk to ? what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the genes that are used to the same as the zebrafish .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ?

was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow i wonder if anybody sued them . four people sued creed for performing very badly at a concert in 2002 .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ;)\nSpeaker A: hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising .\nSpeaker B: does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising !\nSpeaker B: actress ? i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: right ! as a matter of fact , the fiddle and the violin are the same instrument . what sets them apart from each other is the type of music its used to play . i always think of a violin as fancier than a fiddle . \n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , it was a great movie , the first incredibles was based on a video game called incredibles , the incredibles , the sequel , i think that was a great movie\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't have a kindle , but i have n't been to the library in sacramento .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , but i guess it makes sense . i do know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like fish ?\nSpeaker B: i do , tasty animals , do you ?\nSpeaker A: fish is practically a vegetable . they are the food that my food eats .\nSpeaker B: yeah except for fish like the black swallower fish , i hear that one likes to bite\nSpeaker A: i envy that fish 's ability to eat . that is a glorious spectacle . i would go to the buffet everyday .\nSpeaker B: buffet is my favorite kind of restaurant so yea , did you hear about that breed of jellyfish , the one that is immortal !\nSpeaker A: i did not . i wonder what it does all day with its unending life . must get kinda boring . who does it talk to ? what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the genes that are used to the same as the zebrafish .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ? ca n't get any more quirky than that .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ?

was it recorded ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea . i 'm sure that someone has video of it . do you enjoy the music of the foo fighters\nSpeaker A: oh yes , i love them . i love the video of all the drummers and other instruments playing at the same time . people came from all over the world to be in that .\nSpeaker B: they are pretty amazing . they performed a concert so loud that it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow i wonder if anybody sued them . four people sued creed for performing very badly at a concert in 2002 .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: hello , i do nt know , i do nt think i have ever seen that movie , i do nt know about it , what s it about you ?\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ;)\nSpeaker A: hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising .\nSpeaker B: does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising !\nSpeaker B: actress ? i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: right ! as a matter of fact , the fiddle and the violin are the same instrument . what sets them apart from each other is the type of music its used to play . i always think of a violin as fancier than a fiddle . \n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , it was a great movie , the first incredibles was based on a video game called incredibles , the incredibles , the sequel , i think that was a great movie\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't have a kindle , but i have n't been to the library in sacramento .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , but i guess it makes sense . i do know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like fish ?\nSpeaker B: i do , tasty animals , do you ?\nSpeaker A: fish is practically a vegetable . they are the food that my food eats .\nSpeaker B: yeah except for fish like the black swallower fish , i hear that one likes to bite\nSpeaker A: i envy that fish 's ability to eat . that is a glorious spectacle . i would go to the buffet everyday .\nSpeaker B: buffet is my favorite kind of restaurant so yea , did you hear about that breed of jellyfish , the one that is immortal !\nSpeaker A: i did not . i wonder what it does all day with its unending life . must get kinda boring . who does it talk to ? what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the genes that are used to the same as the zebrafish .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ?

i wonder how she did that ...\nSpeaker A: pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !\nSpeaker B: probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: right ! as a matter of fact , the fiddle and the violin are the same instrument . what sets them apart from each other is the type of music its used to play . i always think of a violin as fancier than a fiddle . \n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: d.c . area and all of its attractive locations , sure would be nice to visit it\nSpeaker A: i totally agree with you . i would love to go to the national museum of natural history .\nSpeaker B: i would love to go there too , i hear the building is just awesome\nSpeaker A: they say there are some great coffee shops in the area too . some politicians have been seen at them .\nSpeaker B: yeah around the capitol hill area there is a great coffee store called port city java\nSpeaker A: i bet there are some great restaurants too .\nSpeaker B: yeah there is this great thai place over on takoma park , really good ,\nSpeaker A: i imagine that one is great for if you want to eat healthy . they probably have lots of vegetables and tofu .\nSpeaker B: yeah i hear they have one of the best tofus in the country , so it would be nice to eat there specially if you have food allergies\nSpeaker A: do you know if the area has any great theaters for movies and plays ?\nSpeaker B: thare are , some of them are the kennedy center , imagination stage , adventure theater and ipic theatre , a lot of choices there\nSpeaker A: i bet the ipic theater would be great to see incredibles 2 on .\nSpeaker B: i bet it was , its a nice stage , did you watch that movie by the way ?\nSpeaker A: i have n't seen it yet . i have seen the original though . have you seen either or both of them ?\nSpeaker B: i have seen both and i must say i liked the first one better althought the cast of the 2nd part got an upgrade\nSpeaker A: i 'm not familiar with the cast of the second one . are they big name actors / actresses ?\nSpeaker B: yeah have you watched breaking bad ? well the actor that played saul is one of the new voices\nSpeaker A: oh okay ! say , i heard that the director did one of the voices too . i think he did edna mode .\nSpeaker B: yeah he did , its interesting how he picked the cast for the movie\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it was a great movie , it was a great movie , the first incredibles was based on a video game called incredibles , the incredibles , the sequel , i think that was a great movie\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker B: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker A: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker B: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't have a kindle , but i have n't been to the library in sacramento .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you know much about the internet ?\nSpeaker B: i know a lot about different sites and some website design , how about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , but i guess it makes sense . i do know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like fish ?\nSpeaker B: i do , tasty animals , do you ?\nSpeaker A: fish is practically a vegetable . they are the food that my food eats .\nSpeaker B: yeah except for fish like the black swallower fish , i hear that one likes to bite\nSpeaker A: i envy that fish 's ability to eat . that is a glorious spectacle . i would go to the buffet everyday .\nSpeaker B: buffet is my favorite kind of restaurant so yea , did you hear about that breed of jellyfish , the one that is immortal !\nSpeaker A: i did not . i wonder what it does all day with its unending life . must get kinda boring . who does it talk to ? what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the genes that are used to the same as the zebrafish .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i bet he was a great player . nice chat\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow . we need to get the bright minds of our generation working on saving the planet ! instead , all the smart folks are going to modern tech companies like google . did you know new google employees wear a propeller beanie cap on their first friday ? ca n't get any more quirky than that .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
