baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: maybe it's time to collect some baseball cards now , so you can cash out when you 're older !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of football ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a huge football fan . how about yourself ?\nSpeaker A: i love football both college and nfl , do you have a favorite nfl team of the 32 ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a new england patriots fan and huge fan of tom brady how about you ?\nSpeaker A: nice i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that ! do you know what the highest score in college football was ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's a great idea . i think it 's cool that pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their team if needed .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: do you like football ?\nSpeaker A: i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?\nSpeaker B: yes it is pink but i a not sure why they chose that color\nSpeaker A: i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them\nSpeaker B: i wonder too . bowling was more popular than football in the 60s\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers made more than football players\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?\nSpeaker B: i heard it but i 'm skeptical . that sounds far too high and what 's the definition of \" natural .\nSpeaker A: not sure in this case . when the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long !\nSpeaker B: that was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava . bummer , they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , i think that is so cool . did you know that if earths history was viewed as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: maybe it's time to collect some baseball cards now , so you can cash out when you 're older !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you a fan of football ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a huge football fan . how about yourself ?\nSpeaker A: i love football both college and nfl , do you have a favorite nfl team of the 32 ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm a new england patriots fan and huge fan of tom brady how about you ?\nSpeaker A: nice i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also like the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?\nSpeaker B: no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that ! do you know what the highest score in college football was ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi -

asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah , and what 's funny is that new employees employees are called \" nooglers \" on their basketball field .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi -
