that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i wonder if the un has an ambassador to aliens .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i heard about that ! i wonder how bad that concert must have been .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no i did n't . where 's he from ? \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha ya i do n't know , i do n't know why they do n't have flamethrowers on the back of the car though , i do n't know why they would have wooden trunks on the back\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he was , it was great chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no i did n't . where 's he from ? \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha ya i do n't know , i do n't know why they do n't have flamethrowers on the back of the car though , i do n't know why they would have wooden trunks on the back\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he was , it was great chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i heard about that ! i wonder how bad that concert must have been .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ?

\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha ya i do n't know , i do n't know why they do n't have flamethrowers on the back of the car though , i do n't know why they would have wooden trunks on the back\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he was , it was great chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i heard about that ! i wonder how bad that concert must have been .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ?

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha ya i do n't know , i do n't know why they do n't have flamethrowers on the back of the car though , i do n't know why they would have wooden trunks on the back\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he was , it was great chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no i did n't . where 's he from ?

i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha ya i do n't know , i do n't know why they do n't have flamethrowers on the back of the car though , i do n't know why they would have wooden trunks on the back\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he was , it was great chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i 'm sure they were really strong .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker A: i am well . i am learning about animals and how many there are on our planet . do you know how many ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea but would love to know .\nSpeaker A: there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number\nSpeaker B: wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ?\nSpeaker A: the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating !\nSpeaker B: you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .\nSpeaker A: wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ?\nSpeaker B: yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian .\nSpeaker A: interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ?\nSpeaker B: yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ...\nSpeaker A: it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ?\nSpeaker B: i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free\nSpeaker A: wow . i hope no one hiccups on the radio . do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it is from our evolution when land animals had both gills and lungs \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , do you watch the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: i sure do . do you have a favorite team or player ?\nSpeaker A: i sure do . i love the patriot and tom is amazing . do you have one ?\nSpeaker B: the guys is awesome and now also a book author . did you hear about that ?\nSpeaker A: oh yeah i heard he wrote that book the tb12 method , the athelete 's bible but have not read it yet\nSpeaker B: he is everywhere . i want to read that book but i also want to watch the documentary too\nSpeaker A: same here . do you know he has a favorite ice cream flavor ?\nSpeaker B: oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time\nSpeaker A: yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?\nSpeaker B: that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon\nSpeaker A: yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?\nSpeaker B: yeah and i wonder if that fact that they have longer careers has anything to do with that\nSpeaker A: that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking chips on the players now .\nSpeaker B: yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah . do you know who benjarvus green - ellis is ? \n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i wonder if the un has an ambassador to aliens .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker B: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker A: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker B: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker A: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\nSpeaker B: i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?\nSpeaker A: a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..\nSpeaker B: there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence\nSpeaker A: you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i heard about that ! i wonder how bad that concert must have been .\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: have you heard that people draft contestants for fantasy spelling bee ? pretty amazing to me .\nSpeaker A: i 'm not even sure how they would even know that . are n't all the contestants children ?\nSpeaker B: yes . i guess they see how well they won the regional contests .\nSpeaker A: i mean , i guess fantasy are for the hardcore fans . have you ever seen the lord of the rings ?\nSpeaker B: yes . of course that is fantasy of a different type .\nSpeaker A: the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for \" best picture \"\nSpeaker B: i did not remember that . back to competitive fantasy . there is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for . that seems so boring !\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that . it could be a great teaching tool !\nSpeaker B: yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality .\nSpeaker A: that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses\nSpeaker B: if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my \" reality \" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .\nSpeaker A: there 's even a concentration in tolkien studies . that would be interesting\nSpeaker B: it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .\nSpeaker A: i 've never played fantasy football , but i wonder if kellan moore is a good contender in that since he 's a lefty\nSpeaker B: there is talent and luck in fantasy football . i am sure that moore has had some good games and some poor ones . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that entered college as a junior .\nSpeaker A: he 's pretty smart . it would take a lot of ap courses to knock out the first two years of college like that\nSpeaker B: it sure would . of course , qbs need to be somewhat smart . baker mayfield who won the heisman at oklahoma university almost quite football to go into competitive gaming . he could beat the entire team in halo 3 .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lol , good point . i wonder if anyone at that age in the nfl will ever be able to beat anyone at halo 3 .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: no i did n't . where 's he from ? \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha ya i do n't know , i do n't know why they do n't have flamethrowers on the back of the car though , i do n't know why they would have wooden trunks on the back\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: whoever made the movie trojan wars really dropped the ball on that front . it had a budget of $ 15,000,000 only earned $ 309 in the box office .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi there , how 's it going ?\nSpeaker B: it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?\nSpeaker A: oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .\nSpeaker B: baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?\nSpeaker B: i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .\nSpeaker A: yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?\nSpeaker B: 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .\nSpeaker A: yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?\nSpeaker B: the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .\nSpeaker A: yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics\nSpeaker B: i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .\nSpeaker A: yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \"\nSpeaker B: baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards .\nSpeaker A: right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .\nSpeaker B: some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .\nSpeaker A: yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .\nSpeaker B: thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm sure he was , it was great chatting with you !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
