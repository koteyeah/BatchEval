i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if google is still around . i wonder if the employees who wear a propeller hat to new employees are called nooglers .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess so . did you know women can play too ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ?

staying warm ?\nSpeaker A: trying just watching some netflix .. kyle kinane is hilarious .. one of my favorite comedies .\nSpeaker B: he is funny i know ! lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i love his comedy philosophy . he believes that comedians should n't tell people how the world works , because if they knew that they would n't be comedians ! he manages to be funny without lecturing the audience !\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if google is still around . i wonder if the employees who wear a propeller hat to new employees are called nooglers .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess so . did you know women can play too ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ? do you like sports ?\nSpeaker B: i m great , and yeah i do like to watch sports , basketball , hockey , soccer and even swimming , what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do not but i am more into swimming myself . i do n't like sports , but i do know there are some really boring swimming competitions\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hey , ever use facebook ?\nSpeaker B: i do , it is the primary source of news for 30 % of american adults . do you use facebook your self ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have not used it , but i have heard of it before\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you today ?

i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i can find a library in a cities and check out books !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lowering the entry barrier is always a good thing . do you like pixar ?

he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ?

i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if google is still around . i wonder if the employees who wear a propeller hat to new employees are called nooglers .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess so . did you know women can play too ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ?

i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder if google is still around . i wonder if the employees who wear a propeller hat to new employees are called nooglers .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , do you watch football ?\nSpeaker B: a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football\nSpeaker A: i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?\nSpeaker B: do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in football\nSpeaker A: i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i 'm wrong\nSpeaker A: yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years\nSpeaker B: wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .\nSpeaker A: that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that 's why\nSpeaker B: while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl\nSpeaker A: that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one\nSpeaker B: i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb\nSpeaker A: yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer\nSpeaker B: i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself\nSpeaker A: that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?\nSpeaker A: yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard\nSpeaker B: in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah i guess so . did you know women can play too ?\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ?

i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker A: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker B: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i can find a library in a cities and check out books !\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: lowering the entry barrier is always a good thing . do you like pixar ?

he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ?
