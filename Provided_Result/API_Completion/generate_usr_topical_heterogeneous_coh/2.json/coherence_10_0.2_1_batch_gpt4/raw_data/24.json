i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what doe she do ?

what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: true . they might hold the secret to immortality for us . that would indeed be a long boring life for most people . \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ?

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what doe she do ?

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what doe she do ?

what celebrities does it follow ?\nSpeaker B: i agree , must be a really boring life , still , interesting species might be worthwhile to study them\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: true . they might hold the secret to immortality for us . that would indeed be a long boring life for most people . \n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: are you interested in government related policy\nSpeaker B: i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was .\nSpeaker A: yeah , i can not believe it either\nSpeaker B: i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested .\nSpeaker A: i concur . these are not the best people .\nSpeaker B: i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior .\nSpeaker A: his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure\nSpeaker B: even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .\nSpeaker A: even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime\nSpeaker B: i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged .\nSpeaker A: i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand .\nSpeaker B: it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .\nSpeaker A: i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance\nSpeaker B: no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .\nSpeaker A: okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ?\nSpeaker B: i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?\nSpeaker A: completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .\nSpeaker B: yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i hope there will be no such case in the future . i feel furious reading the article . nice chatting with you \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello\nSpeaker B: hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .\nSpeaker A: that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .\nSpeaker B: what about the problems with the ncaa though ?
