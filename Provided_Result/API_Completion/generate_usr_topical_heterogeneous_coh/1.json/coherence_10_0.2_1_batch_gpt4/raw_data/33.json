however , jordan were them anyways , as nike was willing to pay the fine each game .\nSpeaker B: yeah i think i have read that . nike got the best marketing they ever could so i 'm sure they were happy to pay !\nSpeaker A: i bet they were too . shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments . allen iverson signed a lifetime deal with reebok in 2001 . he 'll get $ 800,000 a year until he 's 55 .\nSpeaker B: i bet they are wishing they could take that back . i think that they thought they were signing the next jordan .\nSpeaker A: he did make a lot for reebok , but they still did n't sell as well as jordans .\nSpeaker B: no , and not for the length of time that jordan has , and probably will continue to be .\nSpeaker A: lebron is about jordan 's only shoe competitor . did you hear that he has signed a deal with warner bros for a new \" space jam \" sequel ?\nSpeaker B: no , i did n't see that . i wonder when it will be released ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm not really sure . maybe it will be as good as the original . lebron has a good character about him though . he raised $ 6 million for charity by televising \" the decision . \"\nSpeaker B: he is a really good person , i know he has donated a ton of money back to ohio .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: yeah he has . he 's the highest paid celebrity right now , but judge judy is right on is coattails . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , do you know much about the box office ?\nSpeaker B: hi , film generates revenue through several medium like television broadcasts right and advertisement . box office is the primary metric for trade .\nSpeaker A: yep . did you know tom hanks is the highest all - time box office star ?\nSpeaker B: yes , avatar is the world wide proclaimed as highest grossing film over 2 billion .\nSpeaker A: i love avatar . it was such a great movie . i heard they are making a second one .\nSpeaker B: animated film are contribute biggest in box office collection . mostly kids liked movie have very high box office .\nSpeaker A: yes for sure . disney once considered shutting down their animation studio because sleeping beauty was a flop at the box office .\nSpeaker B: the projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans . so only they are promoting the films in various way .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: the guy that had a budget of $ 15 million that was a huge loss .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ?

( jazz or otherwise ? )\nSpeaker B: that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .\nSpeaker A: it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !\nSpeaker B: i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii\nSpeaker A: wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...\nSpeaker B: it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters\nSpeaker A: well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?\nSpeaker B: now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ? it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker B: i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ?\nSpeaker A: i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ?\nSpeaker B: i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ?\nSpeaker A: that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ?\nSpeaker B: i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country .\nSpeaker A: that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i did not know that . i wonder if they ever had that rule ?\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .\nSpeaker A: i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway\nSpeaker B: i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .\nSpeaker A: it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .\nSpeaker B: i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .\nSpeaker A: i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .\nSpeaker B: do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .\nSpeaker A: i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .\nSpeaker B: it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that would be a great game to watch . i would have to be a bit slow .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ?
