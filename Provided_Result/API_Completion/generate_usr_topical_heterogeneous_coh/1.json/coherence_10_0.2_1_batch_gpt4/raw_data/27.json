i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ?

i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do ! i love shakespeare . i think he is a great actor and also a great writer\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow people in the 60 's must have really loved bowling ! even today , a lot of niche activities have a dedicated fanbase . there are people that fantasy draft the national spelling bee ! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ?

my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha i like the nationals too , they are my favorite team , i like the costumes , i think the team is really good though , i like the idea of managers and uniforms\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ? do you like sports ?\nSpeaker B: i m great , and yeah i do like to watch sports , basketball , hockey , soccer and even swimming , what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do not but i am more into swimming myself . i do n't like sports , but i do know there are some really boring swimming competitions\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i know reggie miller was a great player but his sister was always better than him .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ?

he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ?

as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow people in the 60 's must have really loved bowling ! even today , a lot of niche activities have a dedicated fanbase . there are people that fantasy draft the national spelling bee ! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ?

( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha i like the nationals too , they are my favorite team , i like the costumes , i think the team is really good though , i like the idea of managers and uniforms\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ? do you like sports ?\nSpeaker B: i m great , and yeah i do like to watch sports , basketball , hockey , soccer and even swimming , what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do not but i am more into swimming myself . i do n't like sports , but i do know there are some really boring swimming competitions\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i know reggie miller was a great player but his sister was always better than him .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

staying warm ?\nSpeaker A: trying just watching some netflix .. kyle kinane is hilarious .. one of my favorite comedies .\nSpeaker B: he is funny i know ! lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know if i 've ever heard of him .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i buy things from amazon all the time . is n't that the clock that 's supposed to run for 10,000 years \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ? he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ? i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do ! i love shakespeare . i think he is a great actor and also a great writer\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow people in the 60 's must have really loved bowling ! even today , a lot of niche activities have a dedicated fanbase . there are people that fantasy draft the national spelling bee ! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ?

i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: when my knees are n't given me trouble , lol ! how about you ? \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha i like the nationals too , they are my favorite team , i like the costumes , i think the team is really good though , i like the idea of managers and uniforms\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ? do you like sports ?\nSpeaker B: i m great , and yeah i do like to watch sports , basketball , hockey , soccer and even swimming , what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do not but i am more into swimming myself . i do n't like sports , but i do know there are some really boring swimming competitions\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i know reggie miller was a great player but his sister was always better than him .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

staying warm ?\nSpeaker A: trying just watching some netflix .. kyle kinane is hilarious .. one of my favorite comedies .\nSpeaker B: he is funny i know ! lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know if i 've ever heard of him .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i buy things from amazon all the time . is n't that the clock that 's supposed to run for 10,000 years \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ? he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ? i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do ! i love shakespeare . i think he is a great actor and also a great writer\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow people in the 60 's must have really loved bowling ! even today , a lot of niche activities have a dedicated fanbase . there are people that fantasy draft the national spelling bee ! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ?

i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: when my knees are n't given me trouble , lol ! how about you ? \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha i like the nationals too , they are my favorite team , i like the costumes , i think the team is really good though , i like the idea of managers and uniforms\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ? do you like sports ?\nSpeaker B: i m great , and yeah i do like to watch sports , basketball , hockey , soccer and even swimming , what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do not but i am more into swimming myself . i do n't like sports , but i do know there are some really boring swimming competitions\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i know reggie miller was a great player but his sister was always better than him .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.

staying warm ?\nSpeaker A: trying just watching some netflix .. kyle kinane is hilarious .. one of my favorite comedies .\nSpeaker B: he is funny i know ! lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't know if i 've ever heard of him .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hey are you aware of banned books week ?\nSpeaker A: i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?\nSpeaker B: i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood\nSpeaker A: are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status\nSpeaker B: yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?\nSpeaker A: not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books\nSpeaker B: well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me\nSpeaker A: true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years\nSpeaker B: i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol\nSpeaker A: considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips\nSpeaker B: i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country\nSpeaker A: i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book\nSpeaker B: well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol\nSpeaker A: children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though\nSpeaker B: haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i buy things from amazon all the time . is n't that the clock that 's supposed to run for 10,000 years \n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ? he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ? i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do ! i love shakespeare . i think he is a great actor and also a great writer\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you still use a landline ?\nSpeaker B: no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines .\nSpeaker A: yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables .\nSpeaker B: even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ?\nSpeaker A: we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures .\nSpeaker B: less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ?\nSpeaker A: youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular .\nSpeaker B: true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ?\nSpeaker A: i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often .\nSpeaker B: i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following .\nSpeaker A: it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility .\nSpeaker B: agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success .\nSpeaker A: do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ?\nSpeaker B: i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street .\nSpeaker A: it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase .\nSpeaker B: it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .\n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: do you like football ?\nSpeaker B: hey ya i like the nfl and college ! my favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offense . what about you ?\nSpeaker A: the quarterback has a lot of responsibilities , he is the leader . too much responsibilities for me . i like defense .\nSpeaker B: oh nice . well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222 - 0 when georgia tech defeated cumberland . no defense for cumberland in that game !\nSpeaker A: i would you feel if you were on the winning team ? as for i would feel kind of bad .\nSpeaker B: yeah i would feel bad too . bad sportsmanship . is n't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960 's !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: wow people in the 60 's must have really loved bowling ! even today , a lot of niche activities have a dedicated fanbase . there are people that fantasy draft the national spelling bee ! \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ?

i though she was a character in a movie , turns out its based on a true story ,\nSpeaker A: yeah i know , right . well another one of his words is laughing stock , haha .\nSpeaker B: yeah so do you like to dance ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: when my knees are n't given me trouble , lol ! how about you ? \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good morning - i love baseball and ca n't wait for spring training to start !\nSpeaker A: hello there ! i am the same , my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so i 'm excited as well !\nSpeaker B: who 's your team ? my team , the diamondbacks had an epic collapse last season and are in a mini - rebuild this season ...\nSpeaker A: yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big .\nSpeaker B: nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) !\nSpeaker A: yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! !\nSpeaker B: yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: haha i like the nationals too , they are my favorite team , i like the costumes , i think the team is really good though , i like the idea of managers and uniforms\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hello , how are you this evening ? do you like sports ?\nSpeaker B: i m great , and yeah i do like to watch sports , basketball , hockey , soccer and even swimming , what about you ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do not but i am more into swimming myself . i do n't like sports , but i do know there are some really boring swimming competitions\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: hi do you watch espn ?\nSpeaker B: hi . yes i do sometimes . they cover some nba games .\nSpeaker A: yes , i am a huge bucks fan . did you see what nick friedell said about the bucks and jabari parker >\nSpeaker B: no i did n't . what did he say ?\nSpeaker A: that they should n't consider signing him . i agree .\nSpeaker B: what made him such a bad player last year ?\nSpeaker A: he did n't do much for the team and was overpaid .\nSpeaker B: has he been injured ? i think they are all over paid personally . i mean they make millions of dollars .\nSpeaker A: for sure , he had to acl injuries so he is definitely injury prone . you know who is better , reggie miller !\nSpeaker B: i 'm not familiar with him . does he play for the bucks too ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i know reggie miller was a great player but his sister was always better than him .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?\nSpeaker A: that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .\nSpeaker B: yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .\nSpeaker A: i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think that was for sure , we should grow , i wonder what planet they are able to make the earth , they will have an alien ambassador to extraterrestrials\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
