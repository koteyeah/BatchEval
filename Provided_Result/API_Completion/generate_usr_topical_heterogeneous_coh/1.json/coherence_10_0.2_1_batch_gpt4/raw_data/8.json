they do wear the uniform after all .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: probably only if they step in and play the game . i 've never seen any of them do it , but that would be an interesting thing to see \n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke\nSpeaker A: i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award\nSpeaker B: yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .\nSpeaker A: i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to\nSpeaker B: sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's interesting that peter gabriel has been in the us , he is a great performer .\n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: the telephone is a great invention ,\nSpeaker B: absolutely ! love the telephone !\nSpeaker A: it makes life a lot more easier , i can check the mail , call and even watch funny videos just by using my phone\nSpeaker B: an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent .\nSpeaker A: that is kind of scary i own an iphone , did nt know i was packing so much power in my front pocket\nSpeaker B: yeah , better be careful ! people use phones for eveything now , i ve seen in movies they attach it to bombs and stuff .\nSpeaker A: powerful weapons if used in the wrong hands , scary since everyone has access to them\nSpeaker B: yeah , seriously . i hear there 's a company that will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do n't use your phone !\nSpeaker A: that is really admirable , donating water to children in need , an awesome campaign\nSpeaker B: yeah great thing to do , water is essential .\nSpeaker A: it is , just like phones have also become essential in our lives , interesting fact about phonebooks , its impossible to separate two of them with their pages fully overlapped\nSpeaker B: lol i never tried but i believe you . do you like clothing ? did you know polo shirts were actually meant for tennis players ?\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that , always thought it was meant for the polo sport or maybe that the polo brand created them\nSpeaker B: same here , yeah a tennis player created them\nSpeaker A: i looks like polo player took the credit then , did you hear about the cultural revolution in china ?\nSpeaker B: no i have nt what s that about ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: china is adopting many aspects of american culture . not sure if that 's a good thing though . i heard at billy mays ' funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis , which i find to be disgraceful .\n\nSample8:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha\nSpeaker A: i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using .\nSpeaker B: haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha\nSpeaker A: yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten .\nSpeaker B: right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious\nSpeaker A: that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?\nSpeaker B: i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute\nSpeaker A: i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way\nSpeaker B: ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military\nSpeaker A: i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe\nSpeaker B: ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion\nSpeaker A: i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .\nSpeaker B: ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! !\nSpeaker A: it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .\nSpeaker B: ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: it must be a really strong cable for sure , so do you like cars ? you know the first car to be mass produced was a ford . \n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you know that facebook and twitter work together on some issues ?

i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ...\nSpeaker B: i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ?\nSpeaker A: that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ?\nSpeaker B: i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great .\nSpeaker A: can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !\nSpeaker B: ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight !\nSpeaker A: really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day .\nSpeaker B: that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ?\nSpeaker A: i 'm for em !\nSpeaker B: they are very interesting . did you know that they do n't have rib cages ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i 'm sure they were really strong .\n\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"I will do my best to provide individual analysis for each sample.
