is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i wonder if the employees who wear propeller cap is called nooglers ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ?

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what doe she do ?

he is a great actor , although i see him more as a comedy actor\nSpeaker A: yeah it did n't make much since to me either . but he says it goes against his belief system .\nSpeaker B: i guess i can respect that , drama can really change your state of mind , i like comedy better , do you follow shakespeare ?\nSpeaker A: not since high school , lol . i hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though .\nSpeaker B: yeah he has had a lot of influence in our culture , there are 33 shakepeare gardens around the world , just imagine that much influence\nSpeaker A: yeah i think one of the phrases he coined was brave new world , so that fits , lol !\nSpeaker B: it does fit lol , its been a long time since he was alive he was born in the year 1564 and there s a lot we do nt know about him\nSpeaker A: yeah apparently him and pocahontas were a live at the same time .\nSpeaker B: pocahontas was a real person ?

i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what doe she do ?

that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the atmosphere , it 's not all that old .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their team if needed .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i wonder if the employees who wear propeller cap is called nooglers ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: my question is , what are they doing with it all ? is that where all the bodies are buried ? \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have not . i have not . what is it about ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what doe she do ?

that 's pretty weird .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i think it 's because of the atmosphere , it 's not all that old .\n\nSample2:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: good afternoon , hope your day is going well !\nSpeaker A: i hope yours is going well , too . baseball is generally played with a bat and ball .\nSpeaker B: baseball is my favorite sport out of the big four - az diamondbacks are my team\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i like the yankees , they are a great team . i think it 's cool that the managers wear uniforms because they can actually play for their team if needed .\n\nSample3:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you see crazy rich asians ?\nSpeaker A: no i have n't . i heard it was good .\nSpeaker B: i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .\nSpeaker A: my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?\nSpeaker B: it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .\nSpeaker A: if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .\nSpeaker B: yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .\nSpeaker A: the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .\nSpeaker B: that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .\nSpeaker A: well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .\nSpeaker B: i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .\nSpeaker A: this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .\nSpeaker B: that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?\nSpeaker A: it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .\nSpeaker B: i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .\nSpeaker A: i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .\nSpeaker B: i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i 'm not sure . i wonder if the employees who wear propeller cap is called nooglers ?\n\nSample4:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .\nSpeaker B: well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .\nSpeaker A: i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .\nSpeaker B: like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .\nSpeaker A: though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .\nSpeaker B: i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .\nSpeaker A: what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's\nSpeaker B: they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: my question is , what are they doing with it all ? is that where all the bodies are buried ? \n\nSample5:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: did you read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i have not . i have not . what is it about ?\n\nSample6:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: i know brady can occasionally blow it but he did n't for me . i 'm a chiefs fan ...\nSpeaker B: even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to .\nSpeaker A: he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed .\nSpeaker B: apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted .\nSpeaker A: probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan .\nSpeaker B: yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ?\nSpeaker A: probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play .\nSpeaker B: me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ?\nSpeaker A: yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ...\nSpeaker B: haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals .\nSpeaker A: did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years .\nSpeaker B: that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me .\nSpeaker A: i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .\nSpeaker B: i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called \" patriot way \" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: what doe she do ? i wonder if she makes more the belichick ? he 's the winningest coach in the nfl for the postseason . \n\nSample7:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?\nSpeaker A: i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n\u2019t put them back on . floppy disks ?

i wonder if george strait 's albums are promoted on amazon site , do you know ?\nSpeaker A: that 's interesting . i would be curious . there is only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . i wonder who they are ?\nSpeaker B: i 'm not sure either . i do n't recall any african american artists in country music . do you know what the fender stratocaster is ?\nSpeaker A: i remember charley pride . he might be one . ... and yes ! it 's a guitar . i think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it .\nSpeaker B: oh ! fender , i see that now ! thanks for clarifying ! do you play any instruments ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: i do love the guitar . did you know u2 opened for themselves ?\n\nSample9:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker B: hi , how are you ?\nSpeaker A: i am well . i am learning about animals and how many there are on our planet . do you know how many ?\nSpeaker B: i have no idea but would love to know .\nSpeaker A: there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number\nSpeaker B: wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ?\nSpeaker A: the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating !\nSpeaker B: you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .\nSpeaker A: wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ?\nSpeaker B: yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian .\nSpeaker A: interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ?\nSpeaker B: yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ...\nSpeaker A: it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ?\nSpeaker B: i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free\nSpeaker A: wow . i hope no one hiccups on the radio . do you know why we hiccup ?\nSpeaker B: i do not , why do we hiccup ?\n\nResponse:\nSpeaker A: they 're a holdover from early evolution when animals had both gills and lungs . hiccups probably helped animals switch between breathing in water and air .\n\nSample10:\n\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A: have you ever watched house ?\nSpeaker B: i have its actually one of my favorite shows , why do you ask ?\nSpeaker A: because he was once the highest paid actor on tv for a drama , $ 700,000 per episode .\nSpeaker B: wow , that seems like a lot of money , i liked the show and all but $ 700000 per episode seems like an excesive salary\nSpeaker A: i agree . apparently jim carry does n't make drama anymore .\nSpeaker B: why does nt he ?
